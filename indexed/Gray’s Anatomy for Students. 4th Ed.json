After some hours, the pain began to localize in the right iliac fossa and became constant. He was referred to an abdominal surgeon, who removed a grossly inflamed appendix. The patient made an uneventful recovery. Pain interpreted as When the appendix becomes inflamed, the visceral sensory originating in distribution fibers are stimulated. These fibers enter the spinal cord with of somatic sensory nerves the sympathetic fibers at spinal cord level T10. The pain is referred to the dermatome of T10, which is in the umbilical region (Fig. 1.50). The pain is diffuse, not focal; every time a peristaltic wave passes through the ileocecal region, the pain recurs. This intermittent type of pain is referred to as colic. In the later stages of the disease, the appendix contacts and irritates the parietal peritoneum in the right iliac fossa, which is innervated by somatic sensory nerves. This produces a constant focal pain, which predominates over the colicky Visceral pain that the patient felt some hours previously. The patient sensory nerve no longer interprets the referred pain from the T10 dermatome. Although this is a typical history for appendicitis, it should always be borne in mind that the patient’s symptoms and signs may vary. The appendix is situated in a retrocecal position in approximately 70% of patients; therefore it may Somatic never contact the parietal peritoneum anteriorly in the right sensory Appendix iliac fossa. It is also possible that the appendix is long and nerve may directly contact other structures. As a consequence, the patient may have other symptoms (e.g., the appendix may contact the ureter, and the patient may then develop Patient perceives diffuse pain in urological symptoms). T10 dermatome Although appendicitis is common, other disorders, for example of the bowel and pelvis, may produce similar symptoms.

Cervical curvature (secondary curvature) As stresses on the back increase from the cervical to lumbar regions, lower back problems are common. Movement Thoracic curvature Muscles of the back consist of extrinsic and intrinsic (primary curvature) groups: ■ The extrinsic muscles of the back move the upper limbs and the ribs. Lumbar curvature ■ The intrinsic muscles of the back maintain posture and (secondary curvature) move the vertebral column; these movements include flexion (anterior bending), extension, lateral flexion, Sacral/coccygeal curvature (primary curvature) and rotation (Fig. 2.3). Although the amount of movement between any two vertebrae is limited, the effects between vertebrae are addi- tive along the length of the vertebral column. Also, freedom Gravity line of movement and extension are limited in the thoracic region relative to the lumbar part of the vertebral column. Muscles in more anterior regions flex the vertebral column. 52 Fig. 2.2 Curvatures of the vertebral column. --- Page 54 --- 2 Conceptual Overview • Functions Extension Flexion Lateral flexion Rotation Fig. 2.3 Back movements.

There are two types of spina bifida. ■ The commonest type is spina bifida occulta, in which there is a defect in the vertebral arch of LV or SI. This defect occurs in as many as 10% of individuals and results in failure of the posterior arch to fuse in the midline. Clinically, the patient is asymptomatic, although physical examination may reveal a tuft of Spinal cord hair over the spinous processes. ■ The more severe form of spina bifida involves complete failure of fusion of the posterior arch at the lumbosacral junction, with a large outpouching of the meninges. This may contain cerebrospinal fluid (a meningocele) or a portion of the spinal cord (a myelomeningocele). These abnormalities may result in a variety of neurological deficits, including problems with walking and bladder function.

This condition occurs in certain disease states, the most dramatic of which is usually secondary to tuberculosis infection of a thoracic vertebral body, where the kyphosis becomes angulated at the site of the lesion.

JOINTS Anulus fibrosus Nucleus pulposus Joints between vertebrae in the back The two major types of joints between vertebrae are: ■ symphyses between vertebral bodies (Fig. 2.31), and ■ synovial joints between articular processes (Fig. 2.32). Layer of A typical vertebra has a total of six joints with adjacent hyaline vertebrae: four synovial joints (two above and two below) cartilage and two symphyses (one above and one below). Each symphysis includes an intervertebral disc. Although the movement between any two vertebrae is limited, the summation of movement among all vertebrae Fig. 2.31 Intervertebral joints. results in a large range of movement by the vertebral column. Movements by the vertebral column include flexion, extension, lateral flexion, rotation, and circumduction. Movements by vertebrae in a specific region (cervical, thoracic, and lumbar) are determined by the shape and orientation of joint surfaces on the articular processes and on the vertebral bodies. 78 --- Page 80 --- 2 Regional Anatomy • Joints Cervical Symphyses between vertebral bodies “Sloped from anterior (intervertebral discs) to posterior” The symphysis between adjacent vertebral bodies is formed Zygapophysial joint by a layer of hyaline cartilage on each vertebral body and an intervertebral disc, which lies between the layers.

In lumbar regions, the joint surfaces are curved and adjacent processes interlock, thereby limiting range of movement, though flexion and extension are still major movements in the lumbar region. “Uncovertebral” joints The lateral margins of the upper surfaces of typical cervi- cal vertebrae are elevated into crests or lips termed uncinate processes. These may articulate with the body of the ver- tebra above to form small “uncovertebral” synovial joints (Fig. 2.33). Superior view Fig. 2.32 Zygapophysial joints. 79 --- Page 81 --- Back In the clinic Back pain Back pain is an extremely common disorder. It can be CIV related to mechanical problems or to disc protrusion impinging on a nerve. In cases involving discs, it may be necessary to operate and remove the disc that is pressing on the nerve. CV Not infrequently, patients complain of pain and no immediate cause is found; the pain is therefore attributed to mechanical discomfort, which may be caused by degenerative disease. One of the treatments is to pass a Uncovertebral joint needle into the facet joint and inject it with local Uncinate process anesthetic and corticosteroid. Fig. 2.33 Uncovertebral joint.

A typical example is rheumatoid arthritis, which primarily affects synovial joints and synovial bursae, resulting in destruction of the joint and its lining. Symphyses are usually preserved. LIGAMENTS Joints between vertebrae are reinforced and supported by numerous ligaments, which pass between vertebral bodies and interconnect components of the vertebral arches. Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments The anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments are on the anterior and posterior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and extend along most of the vertebral column (Fig. 2.35). The anterior longitudinal ligament is attached superiorly to the base of the skull and extends inferiorly to attach to the anterior surface of the sacrum. Along its Anterior longitudinal ligament length it is attached to the vertebral bodies and interverte- bral discs. Fig. 2.35 Anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments of vertebral column. The posterior longitudinal ligament is on the poste- rior surfaces of the vertebral bodies and lines the anterior surface of the vertebral canal.

A weakness in, or an inability to use, the latissimus dorsi, resulting from an injury to the thoracodorsal nerve, diminishes the capacity to pull the body upward while climbing or doing a pull-up. An injury to the dorsal scapular nerve, which innervates the rhomboids, may result in a lateral shift in the position of the scapula on the affected side (i.e., the normal position of the scapula is lost because of the affected muscle’s inability to prevent antagonistic muscles from pulling the scapula laterally).

Axial-loading infection include the lungs and urinary tract. injuries, such as hitting the head while diving into shallow water or hitting the head on the roof of a car in a motor vehicle accident, can cause a “burst” type of fracture, where the ring breaks at more than one site (Fig. 2.58). The British neurosurgeon, Geoffrey Jefferson, first described this fracture pattern in 1920, so these types of fractures are often called Jefferson fractures. Fractures of the axis usually occur due to severe hyperextension and flexion, which can result in fracture of the tip of the dens, base of the dens, or through the body of the atlas. In judicial hangings, there is hyperextension and distraction injury causing fracture through the atlas pedicles and spondylolisthesis of C2 on C3. This type of fracture is often called a hangman’s fracture. In many cases of upper neck injuries, even in the absence of fractures to the atlas or axis, there may be injury to the atlanto-axial ligaments, which can render the neck unstable and pose severe risk to the brainstem and upper spinal cord.

The attending physician performed a physical examination and found that the man had reduced strength during knee extension and when dorsiflexing his feet and toes. He also had reduced reflexes in his knees and ankles, numbness in the perineal (saddle) region, as well as reduced anal sphincter tone. The patient’s symptoms and physical examination findings raised serious concern for compression of multiple lumbar and sacral nerve roots in the spine, affecting both motor and sensory pathways. His reduced power in extending his knees and reduced knee reflexes was suggestive of compression of the L4 nerve roots. His reduced ability to L2-3 intervertebral disc dorsiflex his feet and toes was suggestive of compression of the L5 nerve roots. His reduced ankle reflexes was suggestive of compression of the S1 and S2 nerve roots, and his perineal numbness was suggestive of compression of the S3, S4, and S5 nerve roots. A diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome was made, and the patient was transferred for an urgent MRI scan, roots in the spine, affecting both motor and sensory pathways. His reduced power in extending his knees and reduced knee reflexes was suggestive of compression of the L4 nerve roots. His reduced ability to L2-3 intervertebral disc dorsiflex his feet and toes was suggestive of compression of the L5 nerve roots. His reduced ankle reflexes was suggestive of compression of the S1 and S2 nerve roots, and his perineal numbness was suggestive of compression of the S3, S4, and S5 nerve roots. A diagnosis of cauda equina syndrome was made, and the patient was transferred for an urgent MRI scan, which confirmed the presence of a severely herniating L2-3 disc compressing the cauda equina, giving rise to the cauda equina syndrome (Fig. 2.70).

As a group, the intercostal muscles provide structural support for the intercostal spaces during breathing. They can also move the ribs. External intercostal muscles The eleven pairs of external intercostal muscles extend from the inferior margins (lateral edges of costal grooves) of the ribs above to the superior margins of the ribs below. When the thoracic wall is viewed from a lateral position, the muscle fibers pass obliquely anteroinferiorly (Fig. 3.27). The muscles extend around the thoracic wall from the regions of the tubercles of the ribs to the costal cartilages, where each layer continues as a thin connective tissue aponeurosis termed the external intercostal mem- brane. The external intercostal muscles are most active in inspiration.

When the thoracic wall is viewed from a lateral position, the muscle fibers pass obliquely postero- inferiorly. The internal intercostal muscles are most active during expiration. Innermost intercostal muscles The innermost intercostal muscles are the least distinct of the intercostal muscles, and the fibers have the same orientation as the internal intercostals (Fig. 3.27).

In the clinic High-resolution lung CT Aorta Emphysematous High-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is a diagnostic change in left lung method for assessing the lungs but more specifically the interstitium of the lungs. The technique involves obtaining narrow cross-sectional slices of 1 to 2 mm. These scans enable the physician and radiologist to view the patterns of disease and their distribution. Diseases that may be easily demonstrated using this procedure include emphysema (Fig. 3.52), pneumoconiosis (coal worker’s pneumoconiosis), and asbestosis.

Trachea Dissection flap Trauma Right lung Left lung The aorta has three fixed points of attachment: ■ the aortic valve, ■ the ligamentum arteriosum, and ■ the point of passing behind the median arcuate ligament of the diaphragm to enter the abdomen. The rest of the aorta is relatively free from attachment to other structures of the mediastinum. A serious deceleration injury (e.g., in a road traffic accident) is most likely to cause aortic trauma at these fixed points. Aortic dissection In certain conditions, such as in severe arteriovascular disease, the wall of the aorta can split longitudinally, creating a false channel, which may or may not rejoin into the true Aortic arch—true lumen Aortic arch—false lumen lumen distally (Fig. 3.91). This aortic dissection occurs between the intima and media anywhere along its length. If Fig. 3.91 Axial CT showing aortic dissection.

A clinical diagnosis of platelet emboli was made and a source of the emboli sought. Emboli can arise from many sources. They are clots and plugs of tissue, usually platelets, that are carried from a source to eventually reside in small vessels which they may occlude. Arterial emboli may arise in the heart or in the arteries that supply the region affected. In cases of infected emboli, bacteria grow on the valve and are showered off into the peripheral circulation. A neck radiograph and coronal CT image of the neck A demonstrates a cervical rib (eFig. 3.116). Cervical ribs may produce three distinct disease entities: ■ Arterial compression and embolization—the cervical rib (or band) on the undersurface of the distal portion of the subclavian artery reduces the diameter of the vessel and allows eddy currents to form. Platelets aggregate and atheroma may develop in this region. This debris can be dislodged and flow distally within the upper limb vessels to block off blood flow to the fingers and the hand, a condition called distal embolization. ■ Tension on the T1 nerve—the T1 nerve, which normally passes over rib I, is also elevated by the presence of a cervical rib; thus the patient may experience a sensory disturbance over the medial aspect of the forearm, and develop wasting of the intrinsic muscles of the hand. ■ Compression of the subclavian vein—this may induce axillary vein thrombosis. A Doppler ultrasound scan revealed marked stenosis of the B subclavian artery at the outer border of the rib with Cervical ribs abnormal flow distal to the narrowing. Within this region of abnormal flow there was evidence of thrombus adherent to eFig. 3.116 Cervical ribs. A. Neck radiograph demonstrating the vessel wall. bilateral cervical ribs. B.

It is important to aspirate fluid from these patients to relieve any respiratory impairment and to carry out laboratory tests on the fluid to determine its nature. ■ Severe chest trauma can lead to development of hemopneumothorax. A tube must be inserted to remove the blood and air that has entered the pleural space and prevent respiratory impairment. This man needs treatment to drain either the air or fluid or both.

Appropriate sites for insertion of a chest drain are either in the fourth or fifth intercostal space between the anterior axillary and midaxillary anatomical lines. Case 6 BROKEN PACEMAKER An elderly woman was admitted to the emergency room with severe cardiac failure. She had a left-sided pacemaker box, which had been inserted for a cardiac rhythm disorder (fast atrial fibrillation) many years previously. An ECG demonstrated fast atrial fibrillation. A chest radiograph showed that the wire from the pacemaker had broken under the clavicle. Anatomical knowledge of this region of the chest explains why the wire broke. Many patients have cardiac pacemakers. A wire arises from the pacemaker, which lies within the subcutaneous tissue over the pectoralis major muscle and travels from the pacemaker under the skin to pierce the axillary vein just beneath the clavicle, lateral to the subclavius muscle. The wire then passes through the subclavian vein, the brachiocephalic vein, the superior vena cava, and the right atrium, and lies on the wall of the right ventricle (where it eFig. 3.118 Chest radiograph of an individual with a pacemaker. The pacemaker wires (2) can be seen traveling through the can stimulate the heart to contract) (eFig. 3.118). If the wire venous system to the heart where one ends in the right atrium pierces the axillary vein directly adjacent to the subclavius and the other ends in the right ventricle. muscle, it is possible that after many years of shoulder movement the subclavius muscle stresses and breaks the wire, causing the pacemaker to fail. Every effort is made to place the insertion point of the wire as far laterally as feasible within the first part of the axillary vein. 247.e3 --- Page 252 --- Thorax Case 7 COARCTATION OF THE AORTA A 20-year-old man visited his family doctor because he had a cough. A chest radiograph demonstrated translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI (eFig. 3.119). He was referred to a cardiologist and a diagnosis of coarctation of the aorta was made. The rib notching was caused by dilated collateral intercostal arteries. Coarctation of the aorta is a narrowing of the aorta distal to the left subclavian artery. This narrowing can markedly reduce blood flow to the lower body. Many of the vessels above the narrowing therefore enlarge due to the increased pressure so that blood can reach the aorta below the level of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly. These arteries supply the anterior intercostal arteries, which anastomose with the posterior intercostal arteries that allow blood to flow retrogradely into the aorta. Enlargement of the intertcostal vessels results in notching of the ribs. The first and second posterior intercostal vessels are supplied from the costocervical trunk, which arises from the subclavian artery proximal to the coarctation, so do not enlarge and do not induce rib notching. eFig. 3.119 Chest radiograph demonstrating translucent notches along the inferior border of ribs III to VI. Case 8 AORTIC of the narrowing. Commonly, the internal thoracic, superior epigastric, and musculophrenic arteries enlarge anteriorly.

A diagnosis of chest infection was made. Chest infection is a common disease. In most patients the infection affects the large airways and bronchi. If the infection continues, exudates and transudates are produced, filling the alveoli and the secondary pulmonary lobules. The diffuse patchy nature of this type of infection is termed bronchial pneumonia. Given the patient’s specific clinical findings, bronchial pneumonia was unlikely. From the clinical findings it was clear that the patient was likely to have a pneumonia confined to a lobe. Because there are only two lobes in the left lung, the likely diagnosis was a left upper lobe pneumonia. A chest radiograph was obtained (eFig. 3.121). The posteroanterior view of the chest demonstrated an area of veil-like opacification throughout the whole of the left lung.

A fascial layer of varying thickness separates the abdominal wall from the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal cavity. Abdominal cavity The general organization of the abdominal cavity is one in which a central gut tube (gastrointestinal system) is suspended from the posterior abdominal wall and partly from the anterior abdominal wall by thin sheets of tissue (mesenteries; Fig. 4.6): ■ a ventral (anterior) mesentery for proximal regions of the gut tube; ■ a dorsal (posterior) mesentery along the entire length of the system.

To accomplish dialysis, a small tube is inserted through the abdominal wall and dialysis fluid is injected into the peritoneal cavity. Electrolytes and molecules are exchanged across the peritoneum between the fluid and blood. Once dialysis is completed, the fluid is drained. Peritoneal spread of disease The large surface area of the peritoneal cavity allows infection and malignant disease to spread easily throughout the abdomen (Fig. 4.57). If malignant cells enter the peritoneal cavity by direct invasion (e.g., from colon or ovarian cancer), spread may be rapid. Similarly, a surgeon excising a malignant tumor and releasing malignant cells into the peritoneal cavity may cause an appreciable worsening of the patient’s prognosis. Infection can also spread across the large surface area. The peritoneal cavity can also act as a barrier to, and container of, disease. Intraabdominal infection therefore tends to remain below the diaphragm rather than spread into other body cavities. Perforated bowel A perforated bowel (e.g., caused by a perforated duodenal ulcer) often leads to the release of gas into the peritoneal cavity. This peritoneal gas can be easily visualized on an Free air under diaphragm erect chest radiograph—gas can be demonstrated in extremely small amounts beneath the diaphragm. A patient Fig. 4.58 Radiograph of subdiaphragmatic gas. with severe abdominal pain and subdiaphragmatic gas needs a laparotomy (Fig. 4.58). 303 --- Page 311 --- Abdomen Liver Xiphoid process Stomach Omenta, mesenteries, and ligaments Throughout the peritoneal cavity numerous peritoneal folds connect organs to each other or to the abdominal wall. These folds (omenta, mesenteries, and ligaments) develop from the original dorsal and ventral mesenteries, which suspend the developing gastrointestinal tract in the embryonic coelomic cavity. Some contain vessels and nerves supplying the viscera, while others help maintain the proper positioning of the viscera. Omenta The omenta consist of two layers of peritoneum, which pass from the stomach and the first part of the duodenum to other viscera. There are two: ■ the greater omentum, derived from the dorsal mesen- tery, and ■ the lesser omentum, derived from the ventral mesentery. Greater omentum The greater omentum is a large, apron-like, peritoneal fold that attaches to the greater curvature of the stomach and the first part of the duodenum (Fig. 4.59). It drapes inferiorly over the transverse colon and the coils of the jejunum and ileum (see Fig. 4.54). Turning posteriorly, it ascends to associate with, and become adherent to, the peritoneum on the superior surface of the transverse colon and the anterior layer of the transverse mesocolon before arriving at the posterior abdominal wall.

All of these are derivatives of the dorsal mesentery. Mesentery The mesentery is a large, fan-shaped, double-layered fold of peritoneum that connects the jejunum and ileum to the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 4.61). Its superior attach- ment is at the duodenojejunal junction, just to the left of the upper lumbar part of the vertebral column. It passes obliquely downward and to the right, ending at the ileoce- cal junction near the upper border of the right sacro-iliac joint. In the fat between the two peritoneal layers of the mesentery are the arteries, veins, nerves, and lymphatics that supply the jejunum and ileum. Transverse mesocolon The transverse mesocolon is a fold of peritoneum that Root of the mesentery Root of the sigmoid mesocolon connects the transverse colon to the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 4.61).

The instrument is typically made of a flexible plastic material through which a light source and eyepiece are attached at one end. The images are then projected to a monitor. Some systems allow passage of small instruments through the main bore of the endoscope to obtain biopsies and to also undertake small procedures (e.g., the removal of polyps). In gastrointestinal and abdominal medicine an endoscope is used to assess the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, and proximal small bowel (Figs. 4.72 to 4.75). The tube is swallowed by the patient under light sedation and is extremely well tolerated. Assessment of the colon (colonoscopy) is performed by passage of the long flexible tube through the anus and into the rectum.

Its ascending and descending segments are (secondarily) retroperitoneal and its transverse and sigmoid segments are intraperitoneal. At the junction of the ascending and transverse colon is the right colic flexure, which is just inferior to the right lobe of the liver (Fig. 4.89). A similar, but more acute bend (the left colic flexure) occurs at the junction of the trans- verse and descending colon. This bend is just inferior to the spleen, is higher and more posterior than the right colic flexure, and is attached to the diaphragm by the phrenico- colic ligament. Immediately lateral to the ascending and descending colon are the right and left paracolic gutters (Fig. 4.88). These depressions are formed between the lateral margins of the ascending and descending colon and the posterolat- eral abdominal wall and are gutters through which mate- rial can pass from one region of the peritoneal cavity to another. Because major vessels and lymphatics are on Sigmoid colon the medial or posteromedial sides of the ascending and descending colon, a relatively blood-free mobilization of the ascending and descending colon is possible by cutting the Ascending colon peritoneum along these lateral paracolic gutters. Transverse colon The final segment of the colon (the sigmoid colon) begins above the pelvic inlet and extends to the level of vertebra SIII, where it is continuous with the rectum (Fig. 4.88).

This is where the pancreatic duct converges with the common bile duct. The papilla is initially examined for possible abnormalities (stuck stone or malignant growth) and a biopsy may be taken if necessary. Then either the bile duct or pancreatic duct is cannulated and a small amount of radiopaque contrast medium is injected to visualize either the bile duct (cholangiogram) or pancreatic duct (pancreatogram) (Fig. 4.119). If a stone is present, it can be removed with a stone basket or an extraction balloon. Usually, a sphincterotomy is performed before stone removal to ease its passage through the distal bile duct. In cases of biliary tree obstruction caused by benign or malignant strictures, a stent can be placed into the common bile duct or into one of the main hepatic ducts to allow opening of the narrowed segment. The patency of the newly inserted stent is confirmed by instillation of more contrast medium to demonstrate free flow of contrast through the stent.

In the clinic Spleen disorders Liver Spleen From a clinical point of view, there are two main categories of spleen disorders: rupture and enlargement. Splenic rupture This tends to occur when there is localized trauma to the left upper quadrant. It may be associated with left lower rib fractures. Because the spleen has such an extremely thin capsule, it is susceptible to injury even when there is no damage to surrounding structures, and because the spleen is highly vascular, when ruptured, it bleeds profusely into the peritoneal cavity. Splenic rupture should always be suspected with blunt abdominal injury. Current treatments preserve as much of the spleen as possible, but some patients require splenectomy. Splenic enlargement The spleen is an organ of the reticuloendothelial system involved in hematopoiesis and immunological surveillance. Diseases that affect the reticuloendothelial system (e.g., leukemia or lymphoma) may produce generalized lymphadenopathy and enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) (Fig. 4.120). The spleen often enlarges when performing its normal physiological functions, such as when clearing microorganisms and particulates from the circulation, producing increased antibodies in the course of Fig. 4.120 Coronal CT of the abdomen containing a massively sepsis, or removing deficient or destroyed erythrocytes (e.g., enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). in thalassemia and spherocytosis). Splenomegaly may also be a result of increased venous pressure caused by congestive heart failure, splenic vein thrombosis, or portal hypertension. An enlarged spleen is prone to rupture. 342 --- Page 350 --- 4 Regional Anatomy • Abdominal Viscera Arterial supply Anterior branches of the abdominal aorta The abdominal aorta begins at the aortic hiatus of the The abdominal aorta has anterior, lateral, and posterior diaphragm, anterior to the lower border of vertebra TXII branches as it passes through the abdominal cavity.

the abdominal Superior mesenteric artery aorta and at the openings of the celiac trunk and the Middle colic artery Marginal artery superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric arteries. Not infrequently, the inferior mesenteric artery becomes occluded. Interestingly, many of these patients do not suffer any complications, because anastomoses between the right, middle, and left colic arteries gradually enlarge, forming a continuous marginal artery. The distal large bowel therefore becomes supplied by this enlarged marginal artery (marginal artery of Drummond), which replaces the blood supply of the inferior mesenteric artery (Fig. 4.130). If the openings of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery become narrowed, the blood supply to the gut is diminished. After a heavy meal, the oxygen demand of the bowel therefore outstrips the limited supply of blood through the stenosed vessels, resulting in severe pain and discomfort (mesenteric angina). Patients with this condition tend not to eat because of the pain and rapidly lose weight. The diagnosis is determined by aortic angiography, and the stenoses of the celiac trunk and superior mesenteric artery are best appreciated in the lateral view.

Lymph from viscera is supplied by three routes: ■ The celiac trunk (i.e., structures that are part of the abdominal foregut) drains to pre-aortic nodes near the origin of the celiac trunk (Fig. 4.134)—these celiac nodes also receive lymph from the superior mesenteric and inferior mesenteric groups of pre-aortic nodes, and lymph from the celiac nodes enters the cisterna chyli. ■ The superior mesenteric artery (i.e., structures that are part of the abdominal midgut) drains to pre-aortic nodes near the origin of the superior mesenteric artery (Fig. 4.134)—these superior mesenteric nodes also receive lymph from the inferior mesenteric groups of pre-aortic nodes, and lymph from the superior mesen- teric nodes drains to the celiac nodes. ■ The inferior mesenteric artery (i.e., structures that are part of the abdominal hindgut) drains to pre-aortic nodes near the origin of the inferior mesenteric artery (Fig. 4.134), and lymph from the inferior mesenteric nodes drains to the superior mesenteric nodes.

Between each lumbar vertebra is an intervertebral disc, which completes this part of the midline boundary of the Vertebra LIII posterior abdominal wall. The midline boundary of the posterior abdominal wall, Rib XII inferior to the lumbar vertebrae, consists of the upper margin of the sacrum (Fig. 4.141). The sacrum is formed Rib XI by the fusion of the five sacral vertebrae into a single, wedge-shaped bony structure that is broad superiorly and narrows inferiorly. Its concave anterior surface and its convex posterior surface contain anterior and posterior Iliac crest sacral foramina for the anterior and posterior rami of spinal nerves to pass through. Pelvic bones Ilium The ilia, which are components of each pelvic bone, attach laterally to the sacrum at the sacro-iliac joints (Fig. 4.141). The upper part of each ilium expands outward into a thin wing-like area (the iliac fossa). The medial side of this region of each iliac bone, and the related muscles, are components of the posterior abdominal wall. Ribs Superiorly, ribs XI and XII complete the bony framework of Anterior superior the posterior abdominal wall (Fig. 4.141). These ribs are iliac spine unique in that they do not articulate with the sternum or other ribs, they have a single articular facet on their heads, and they do not have necks or tubercles.

Psoas major and minor Medially, the psoas major muscles cover the anterolateral surface of the bodies of the lumbar vertebrae, filling in the space between the vertebral bodies and the transverse processes (Fig. 4.142). Each of these muscles arises from the bodies of vertebra TXII and all five lumbar vertebrae, from the intervertebral discs between each vertebra, and from the transverse processes of the lumbar vertebrae.

This venous extension is rare for any other type of tumor, so, when seen, renal cell carcinoma should be suspected. In addition, the tumor may spread along the renal vein and into the inferior vena cava, and in rare cases can grow into the right atrium across the tricuspid valve and into the pulmonary artery. Treatment for most renal cancers is surgical removal, even when metastatic spread is present, because some patients show regression of metastases.

The head of the pancreas lies within the curve of the duodenum, primarily adjacent to the descending part of the duodenum. Any tumor mass in the region of the head of the pancreas is likely to expand and may encase and invade the duodenum. Unfortunately, in this patient’s case, this happened, Tumor producing almost complete obstruction. Further discussion with the patient revealed that she was vomiting relatively undigested food soon after each meal. A CT scan demonstrated further complications. In the region of the head and neck of the pancreas are complex anatomical structures, which may be involved with a malignant process. The CT scan confirmed a mass in the region of the head of the pancreas, which invaded the descending part of the duodenum. The mass extended into the neck of the pancreas and had blocked the distal part of the bile duct and the pancreatic duct. Posteriorly the mass had directly invaded the portal venous confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins, producing a series of gastric, splenic, and small bowel varices.

The patient developed malignant melanoma in the foot, which spread to the lymph nodes of the groin. The inguinal lymph nodes were resected; however, it was noted on follow-up imaging that the patient had developed two metastatic lesions within the right lobe of the liver. Surgeons and physicians considered the possibility of removing these lesions. A CT scan was performed that demonstrated the lesions within segments V and VI of the liver (Fig. 4.186). The segmental anatomy of the liver is important because it enables the surgical planning for resection. The surgery was undertaken and involved identifying the portal vein and the confluence of the right and left Middle hepatic vein hepatic ducts.

One issue is liver function. The patient was referred to the radiology department for a transjugular liver biopsy. The skin around the jugular vein in the neck was Biopsy needle in right hepatic vein anesthetized. Access was obtained through insertion of a needle and a guidewire. The guidewire was advanced through the right internal jugular vein and into the right brachiocephalic vein. It entered the superior vena cava, was passed along the posterior wall of the atrium, and entered the superior aspect of the inferior vena cava. A catheter was inserted over the wire and directed into the right hepatic vein. Using a series of dilators, the hole was enlarged and a biopsy needle was placed over the wire and into the right hepatic vein. The liver was biopsied through the right hepatic vein and the biopsy sample was removed. A simple suture was used to close the internal jugular vein in the neck, and minor compression stemmed any blood flow.

Typically, the observation chart revealed a “swinging” pyrexia (fever). The patient made a slow and uneventful recovery. The most common sites for abscess to develop are the pelvis and the hepatorenal recess. When a patient is in the supine position, the lowest points in the abdominal and pelvic cavities are the posterior superior Subphrenic collection of pus and gas aspect of the peritoneal cavity (the hepatorenal recess) and, in women, the recto-uterine pouch (pouch of Douglas). The shoulder pain suggested that the abscess was in the hepatorenal recess and that the pain was referred from the diaphragm. The motor and sensory innervation of the diaphragm is from nerves C3 to C5. The somatic pain sensation from the parietal peritoneum covering the undersurface of the diaphragm is carried into the spinal cord by the phrenic nerve (C3 to C5) and is interpreted by the brain as coming from skin over the shoulder—a region supplied by other somatic sensory nerves entering the same levels of the spinal cord as those from the diaphragm.

It is also possible that a small ureteric perforation occurred, allowing bacteria to enter the urinary tract. The patient made a further uneventful recovery with resumption of normal renal function and left the hospital. On return to the surgeon in the outpatient clinic some weeks later, the patient did not wish to continue with his colostomy and bag.

At birth, these bones are connected by cartilage in the area of the acetabulum; later, at between 16 and 18 years of age, they fuse into a single bone (Fig. 5.20). Ilium Of the three components of the pelvic bone, the ilium is Ilium the most superior in position. The ilium is separated into upper and lower parts by a ridge on the medial surface (Fig. 5.21A). ■ Posteriorly, the ridge is sharp and lies immediately supe- rior to the surface of the bone that articulates with the sacrum. This sacral surface has a large L-shaped facet Ischium Pubis for articulating with the sacrum and an expanded, pos- terior roughened area for the attachment of the strong ligaments that support the sacro-iliac joint (Fig. 5.21). ■ Anteriorly, the ridge separating the upper and lower parts of the ilium is rounded and termed the arcuate line.

In the clinic Bladder cancer Renal pelvis Bladder cancer (Fig. 5.44) is the most common tumor of the urinary tract and is usually a disease of the sixth and seventh decades, although there is an increasing trend for younger patients to develop this disease. Approximately one-third of bladder tumors are multifocal; fortunately, two-thirds are superficial tumors and amenable to local treatment. Bladder tumors may spread through the bladder wall and invade local structures, including the rectum, uterus (in women), and lateral walls of the pelvic cavity. Prostatic involvement is not uncommon in male patients. The disease spreads via the internal iliac lymph nodes. Spread to distant metastatic sites rarely includes the lung. Large bladder tumors may produce complications, including invasion and obstruction of the ureters. Ureteric obstruction can then obstruct the kidneys and induce kidney failure. Moreover, bladder tumors can invade other structures of the pelvic cavity. Treatment for early-stage tumors includes local resection with preservation of the bladder. Diffuse tumors may be treated with local chemotherapy; more extensive tumors may require radical surgical removal of the bladder (cystectomy) and, in men, the prostate (prostatectomy). Bladder reconstruction (formation of so-called neobladder) is Small tumor Bladder performed in patients after cystectomy using part of a bowel, most commonly the ileum.

The egg passes into the uterine tube where it is normally fertilized in the ampulla. The zygote then begins development and passes into the uterine cavity where it implants in the uterine wall. A simple and effective method of birth control is to Axis of vagina surgically ligate (clip) the uterine tubes, preventing spermatozoa from reaching the ovum. This simple short Axis of procedure is performed under general anesthetic. A small uterine laparoscope is passed into the peritoneal cavity and body special equipment is used to identify the tubes. Axis of cervix Angle of anteflexion Cervix A Angle of anteversion The cervix forms the inferior part of the uterus and is shaped like a short, broad cylinder with a narrow central Internal os channel. The body of the uterus normally arches forward (anteflexed on the cervix) over the superior surface of the emptied bladder (Fig. 5.55A). In addition, the cervix is angled forward (anteverted) on the vagina so that the Posterior inferior end of the cervix projects into the upper anterior fornix aspect of the vagina.

Diagnosis is by inspection, cytology (examination of the cervical cells), imaging, biopsy, and dilation and curettage (D&C) of the uterus. Carcinoma of the cervix and uterus may be treated by local resection, removal of the uterus (hysterectomy), and adjuvant chemotherapy. The tumor spreads via lymphatics to the internal and common iliac lymph nodes. Many countries have introduced screening programs for cervical Vaginal vault cancer where women are regularly called for smear tests. The age of women included in the screening population varies depending on the country.

The anterior wall of the vagina is related to the base of the bladder and to the urethra; in fact, the urethra is embedded in, or fused to, the anterior vaginal wall. Posteriorly, the vagina is related principally to the rectum. Inferiorly, the vagina opens into the vestibule of the perineum immediately posterior to the external opening of the urethra. From its external opening (the introitus), the vagina courses posterosuperiorly through the perineal Fig. 5.56 Picture taken through a speculum inserted into the membrane and into the pelvic cavity, where it is attached vagina demonstrating cervical cancer.

Prolapsed infection can tract superiorly into the pelvic cavity or hemorrhoids are internal hemorrhoids that pass outside laterally into the ischio-anal fossae. the anal canal and form lumps, which may undergo thrombosis and become painful. There are many treatments for hemorrhoids, which include ligation above the pectinate (dentate) line using simple rubber bands or surgical excision. Surgery to this region is not without complications and care must be taken to preserve the internal anal sphincter. In the back of every physician’s mind is the concern that the rectal bleeding or symptoms may not be attributable to hemorrhoids.

He was otherwise healthy and had no other symptoms. During examination, the physician palpated the left testis, which was normal, although he noted soft nodular swelling around the superior aspect of the testes and the epididymis. In his clinical notes, he described these findings as a “bag of worms” (Fig. 5.86). The bag of worms was a varicocele. The venous drainage of the testis is via the pampiniform plexus of veins that runs within the spermatic cord. A varicocele is a collection of dilated veins that arise from the pampiniform plexus. In many ways, they are similar to varicose veins that develop in the legs. Typically, the patient complains of a dragging feeling in the scrotum and around the testis, which is usually worse toward the end of the day. The family physician recommended surgical treatment, with a recommendation for surgery through an inguinal incision. A simple surgical technique divides the skin around the inguinal ligament. The aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated. Another option is to embolize the varicocele. In this technique, a small catheter is placed via the right femoral vein. The catheter is advanced along the external iliac vein and the common iliac vein and into the inferior vena cava. The catheter is then positioned in the left renal vein, and a venogram is performed to demonstrate the origin of the left testicular vein. The catheter is advanced down the left the external oblique muscle is divided in the anterior abdominal wall to display the spermatic cord. Careful inspection of the spermatic cord reveals the veins, which are surgically ligated. Another option is to embolize the varicocele. In this technique, a small catheter is placed via the right femoral vein. The catheter is advanced along the external iliac vein and the common iliac vein and into the inferior vena cava. The catheter is then positioned in the left renal vein, and a venogram is performed to demonstrate the origin of the left testicular vein. The catheter is advanced down the left testicular vein into the veins of the inguinal canal and the pampiniform plexus. Metal coils to occlude the vessels are injected, and the catheter is withdrawn. The patient asked how blood would drain from the testis after the operation. Penis Pampiniform plexus Although the major veins of the testis had been occluded, small collateral veins running within the scrotum and around Fig. 5.86 Left testicular venogram demonstrating the pampiniform plexus of veins. the outer aspect of the spermatic cord permitted drainage without recurrence of the varicocele. 522 --- Page 536 --- 5 Clinical Cases • Case 2 Case 2 PELVIC KIDNEY Pelvic kidney Sacrum A young woman visited her family practitioner because she had mild upper abdominal pain. An ultrasound L3 demonstrated gallstones within the gallbladder, which explained the patient’s pain. However, when the technician assessed the pelvis, she noted a mass behind the bladder, L4 which had sonographic findings similar to a kidney (Fig. 5.87). What did the sonographer do next? Having demonstrated L5 this pelvic mass behind the bladder, the sonographer assessed both kidneys. The patient had a normal right kidney. However, the left kidney could not be found in its usual place. The technician diagnosed a pelvic kidney. A pelvic kidney can be explained by the embryology. The kidneys develop from a complex series of structures that originate adjacent to the bladder within the fetal pelvis. As development proceeds and the functions of the various parts of the developing kidneys change, they attain a superior position in the upper abdomen adjacent to the abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava, on the posterior abdominal wall. A developmental arrest or complication may prevent the kidney from obtaining its usual position. Fortunately, it is unusual for patients to have any symptoms Bladder Rectum relating to a pelvic kidney.

The blood supply to the head and neck is primarily from an arterial ring formed by the branches of the medial and lateral circumflex femoral arteries around the base of the femoral neck. From here, vessels course along the neck, penetrate the capsule, and supply the femoral head. The blood supply to the femoral head and femoral neck is further enhanced by the artery of the ligamentum teres, a branch of the obturator artery, which is generally small and variable. Femoral neck fractures may disrupt associated vessels and lead to necrosis of the femoral head. Femoral neck fractures can be divided into three categories depending on the location of the fracture line: subcapital (fracture line passes across the femoral head-neck junction), transcervical (fracture line passes through the midportion of the femoral neck), and basicervical (fracture line passes across the base of the neck). Subcapital fractures have the highest risk of developing necrosis of the femoral head, and basicervical fractures have the lowest risk. Elderly patients with osteoporosis tend to have transverse subcapital fractures following low-energy trauma such as a fall from a standing height. Conversely, younger patients usually sustain more vertical fractures of the distal femoral neck (basicervical) after high-energy trauma such as a fall from a great height or due to axial load applied to an abducted knee, such as during a motor vehicle accident. Fractured neck of femur Fig. 6.28 This radiograph of the pelvis, anteroposterior view, demonstrates a fracture of the neck of the femur. 549 --- Page 567 --- Lower Limb In the clinic Intertrochanteric fractures Intertrochanteric fracture In these fractures, the break usually runs from the greater trochanter through to the lesser trochanter and does not involve the femoral neck. Intertrochanteric fractures preserve the femoral neck blood supply and do not render the femoral head ischemic. They are most commonly seen in the elderly and result from low-energy impact (Fig. 6.29). Sometimes isolated fractures of the greater or the lesser trochanter can occur. An isolated fracture of the lesser trochanter in adults is most commonly pathological and due to an underlying malignant deposit.

The The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is most frequently management, as in ACL injury, depends on the degree of the injured during non-contact activities when there is a sudden injury (sprain, partial thickness, full thickness) and the level change in the direction of movement (cutting or pivoting) of desired activity. (Fig. 6.81). Contact sports may also result in ACL injury due to sudden twisting, hyperextension, and valgus force related to direct collision. The injury usually affects the mid-portion ACL rupture of the ligament and manifests itself as a complete or partial discontinuity of the fibers or abnormal orientation and contour of the ligament. With an acute ACL tear, a sudden click or pop can be heard and the knee becomes rapidly swollen. Several tests are used to clinically assess the injury, and the diagnosis is usually confirmed by MRI. A full thickness ACL tear causes instability of the knee joint. The treatment depends on the desired level of activity of the patient. In those with high activity levels, surgical reconstruction of the ligament is required. Those with low activity levels may opt for knee bracing and physiotherapy; however, in the long term the internal damage to the knee leads to the development of early osteoarthritis. A tear to the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) requires significant force, so it rarely occurs in isolation. It usually occurs during hyperextension of the knee or as a result of a direct blow to a bent knee such as when striking the knee against the dashboard in a motor vehicle accident. Typically, the injury presents as posterior displacement of the tibia on physical examination (the so called tibial sag sign).

In the proximal leg, the anterior tibial artery has a recurrent branch, which connects with the anastomotic network of vessels around the knee joint. Along its course, the anterior tibial artery supplies numerous branches to adjacent muscles and is joined by the perforating branch of the fibular artery, which passes forward through the lower aspect of the interosseous membrane from the posterior compartment of the leg. Deep fibular nerve Distally, the anterior tibial artery gives rise to an ante- rior medial malleolar artery and an anterior lateral malleolar artery, which pass posteriorly around the Anterior tibial artery distal ends of the tibia and fibula, respectively, and connect with vessels from the posterior tibial and fibular arteries to form an anastomotic network around the ankle.

The foot is the body’s point of contact with the ground and provides a stable platform for upright stance. It also levers the body forward during walking. In the clinic Common fibular nerve injury The common fibular nerve is susceptible to injury as it passes around the lateral aspect of the neck of the fibula. It can be injured as a result of a direct trauma (blow or laceration), secondary to knee injury (knee dislocation), or as a consequence of a proximal fibular fracture. Sometimes damage to the nerve can be iatrogenic, that is, damaged during arthroscopy or knee surgery. Symptoms of common fibular nerve injury are often observed in bed-bound patients, particularly in those with decreased levels of consciousness, due to prolonged external pressure to the knee leading to nerve compression and neuropathy. Similarly, application of a tight cast or a brace to the leg can compress the nerve, producing symptoms of fibular muscle palsy. Apart from a foot drop, other symptoms of common fibular nerve injury include loss of sensation over the lateral aspect of the leg and dorsum of the foot, and wasting of fibular and anterior tibial muscles. 627 --- Page 645 --- Lower Limb Abduction Adduction Great toe Digit I Digit II Digit III Digit IV Phalanges Digit V Little toe Sesamoid bones Metatarsals (I–V) Tarsal bones Lateral malleolus Cut surface of medial Medial malleolus malleolus (tibia) Cut surface of lateral malleolus (fibula) Calcaneal tendon Heel A B Fig. 6.95 Foot.

Talar beak Joints Occasionally there is a superior projection of the distal aspect of the talus, which is beak-shaped (Fig. 6.101). It is Ankle joint often associated with the presence of a bony or fibrous The ankle joint is synovial in type and involves the joint between the talus and calcaneus. talus of the foot and the tibia and fibula of the leg (Fig. 6.102). The ankle joint mainly allows hinge-like dorsiflexion Talar beak and plantarflexion of the foot on the leg. The distal end of the fibula is firmly anchored to the larger distal end of the tibia by strong ligaments. Together, the fibula and tibia create a deep bracket-shaped socket for the upper expanded part of the body of the talus: ■ The roof of the socket is formed by the inferior surface of the distal end of the tibia. ■ The medial side of the socket is formed by the medial malleolus of the tibia. ■ The longer lateral side of the socket is formed by the lateral malleolus of the fibula. The articular surfaces are covered by hyaline cartilage. The articular part of the talus is shaped like a short half-cylinder tipped onto its flat side with one end facing lateral and the other end facing medial. The curved upper surface of the half-cylinder and the two ends are covered by hyaline cartilage and fit into the bracket-shaped socket formed by the distal ends of the tibia and fibula. When viewed from above, the articular surface of the talus is much wider anteriorly than it is posteriorly. As a result, the bone fits tighter into its socket when the foot is dorsiflexed and the wider surface of the talus moves into the ankle joint than when the foot is plantarflexed and the narrower part of the talus is in the joint. The joint is there- fore most stable when the foot is dorsiflexed.

Instead, they form longitudinal and transverse arches rela- tive to the ground (Fig. 6.113), which absorb and distribute downward forces from the body during standing and moving on different surfaces. Medial longitudinal arch Longitudinal arch The longitudinal arch of the foot is formed between the posterior end of the calcaneus and the heads of the meta- tarsals (Fig. 6.113A). It is highest on the medial side, where it forms the medial part of the longitudinal arch, and lowest on the lateral side, where it forms the lateral part.

Fig. 6.126 Superficial veins of the right foot. 655 --- Page 673 --- Lower Limb Tibial nerve The tibial nerve enters the foot through the tarsal tunnel posterior to the medial malleolus. In the tunnel, the nerve is lateral to the posterior tibial artery, and gives origin to medial calcaneal branches, which penetrate the flexor retinaculum to supply the heel. Midway between the medial malleolus and the heel, the tibial nerve bifurcates with the posterior tibial artery into: ■ a large medial plantar nerve, and ■ a smaller lateral plantar nerve (Fig. 6.127). The medial and lateral plantar nerves lie together between their corresponding arteries. Medial plantar nerve Superficial branch The medial plantar nerve is the major sensory nerve in Deep the sole of the foot (Fig. 6.127). It innervates skin on most branch of the anterior two-thirds of the sole and adjacent surfaces of the medial three and one-half toes, which includes the great toe. In addition to this large area of plantar skin, the nerve also innervates four intrinsic muscles—the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, flexor hallucis brevis, and first lumbrical. Lateral plantar Medial plantar The medial plantar nerve passes into the sole of the foot nerve nerve deep to the abductor hallucis muscle and forward in the groove between the abductor hallucis and flexor digitorum brevis, supplying branches to both these muscles. The medial plantar nerve supplies a digital branch (proper plantar digital nerve) to the medial side of the Tibial nerve great toe and then divides into three nerves (common plantar digital nerves) on the plantar surface of the flexor digitorum brevis, which continue forward to supply A proper plantar digital branches to adjacent surfaces of toes I to IV. The nerve to the first lumbrical originates from the first common plantar digital nerve. Lateral plantar nerve Medial plantar nerve The lateral plantar nerve is an important motor nerve Lateral plantar in the foot because it innervates all intrinsic muscles in the nerve sole, except for the muscles supplied by the medial plantar nerve (the abductor hallucis, flexor digitorum brevis, flexor Saphenous nerve hallucis brevis, and first lumbrical) (Fig. 6.127). It also Sural nerve innervates a strip of skin on the lateral side of the anterior two-thirds of the sole and the adjacent plantar surfaces of the lateral one and one-half digits.

Extensor digitorum In the clinic brevis Morton’s neuroma A Morton’s neuroma is an enlarged common plantar nerve, usually in the third interspace between the third and fourth toes. In this region of the foot the lateral plantar nerve often unites with the medial plantar nerve. As the two nerves join, the resulting nerve is typically larger in diameter than those of the other toes. Also, it is in a relatively subcutaneous position, just above the fat pad of the foot close to the artery and the vein. Above the nerve is the deep transverse metatarsal ligament, which is a broad strong structure holding the metatarsals together. Typically, as the patient enters the “push-off” phase of walking the interdigital nerve is sandwiched between the ground and the deep transverse metatarsal ligament.

A Femur Popliteal vein Patella Vastus medialis clinical diagnosis of footdrop was made and a common fibular nerve injury was diagnosed. The injury occurred at the time of surgery. Within the popliteal fossa are the popliteal artery, popliteal vein, and sciatic nerve (and its divisions). The popliteal artery is the deepest structure. The popliteal vein is superficial to the artery and the sciatic nerve is superficial to the vein (eFig. 6.142). Importantly, the sciatic nerve divides at the apex of the popliteal fossa. The tibial nerve continues into the lower popliteal fossa. The common fibular nerve passes laterally adjacent to the biceps femoris muscle to become superficial and wrap around the fibula neck. It was concluded that the surgeon had accidentally ligated the common fibular nerve rather than the small saphenous vein, thus producing this patient’s symptoms.

Some flow was demonstrated in the deep Embolus Left atrium femoral vein and in the great saphenous vein. No flow was demonstrated throughout the length of the left femoral vein, the popliteal vein, and the tibial veins. The technician scanned the opposite side, where excellent flow was demonstrated within the right femoral venous system. In addition, when the calf was gently massaged an augmentation to the flow was noted. It was possible to demonstrate alteration of flow with respiratory excursion and venous compression was satisfactory. A diagnosis of extensive left-sided deep vein thrombosis was made. Certain patients are more prone to deep vein thrombosis. Three major factors predispose a patient to thrombosis: ■ reduced or stagnant blood flow in the veins—significant stasis of blood (which may be due to lack of movement), reduced muscular calf pump effect, and obstruction to flow may occur; ■ injury to the vein wall—venous trauma may damage the Aorta vessel walls, promoting thrombus formation; Right inferior pulmonary artery with embolus ■ hypercoagulability of the blood—hypercoagulable states are often associated with abnormal levels of certain eFig. 6.143 Pulmonary embolus.

During a game he attempted a forehand shot and noticed severe sudden pain in his heel. He thought his opponent had hit him with his racket. When he turned, though, he realized his opponent was too far away to have hit him. Within minutes there was marked swelling of the ankle. The patient was unable to plantarflex his foot and had to stop the game. Afterward an appreciable subcutaneous hematoma developed in the ankle. The diagnostic possibilities include a bone or soft tissue injury. A bony injury was excluded because there was no bone tenderness. The patient had a significant soft tissue injury. On examination he had significant swelling of the ankle with a subcutaneous hematoma. He was unable to stand on tiptoe on the right leg, and in the prone position a palpable defect was demonstrated within the calcaneal tendon. A diagnosis of calcaneal tendon rupture was made. This patient has a typical history of ruptured calcaneal Talus Calcaneus tendon and the clinical findings support this. Magnetic resonance imaging was carried out and confirmed the eFig. 6.144 Ankle showing a ruptured calcaneal tendon.

Acromion Clavicle The acromial end of the clavicle tends to dislocate at the acromioclavicular joint with trauma (Fig. 7.31). The outer third of the clavicle is joined to the scapula by the conoid and trapezoid ligaments of the coracoclavicular ligament. A minor injury tends to tear the fibrous joint capsule and ligaments of the acromioclavicular joint, resulting in acromioclavicular separation on a plain radiograph. More severe trauma will disrupt the conoid and trapezoid ligaments of the coracoclavicular ligament, which results in elevation and upward subluxation of the clavicle.

Once the joint capsule and cartilage are disrupted, the joint is susceptible to further (recurrent) dislocations. When an anteroinferior dislocation occurs, the axillary nerve may be injured by direct compression of the humeral head on the nerve inferiorly as it passes through the quadrangular space.

The muscle most commonly involved is supraspinatus as it passes beneath the acromion and the acromioclavicular ligament. This space, beneath which the supraspinatus tendon passes, is of fixed dimensions. Swelling of the supraspinatus muscle, excessive fluid within the subacromial/subdeltoid bursa, or subacromial bony spurs may produce significant impingement when the arm is abducted. The blood supply to the supraspinatus tendon is relatively poor. Repeated trauma, in certain circumstances, makes the tendon susceptible to degenerative change, which may result in calcium deposition, producing extreme pain. The calcium deposits can be extracted through a needle under image guidance and often have the consistency of toothpaste. When the supraspinatus tendon has undergone significant degenerative change, it is more susceptible to trauma, and partial- or full-thickness tears may develop (Fig. 7.33). These tears are most common in older patients and may result in considerable difficulty in carrying out normal activities of daily living such as combing hair. However, complete tears may be entirely asymptomatic.

It encloses the subclavius and pectoralis minor V and from the fascia overlying muscles of the related muscles and spans the gap between them. intercostal spaces.

Intercostobrachial nerve The only major structure that passes directly through the medial wall and into the axilla is the intercostobrachial nerve (Fig. 7.43). This nerve is the lateral cutaneous Pectoralis branch of the second intercostal nerve (anterior ramus of major T2). It communicates with a branch of the brachial plexus (the medial cutaneous nerve of the arm) in the axilla and supplies skin on the upper posteromedial side of the arm, which is part of the T2 dermatome. In the clinic ”Winging” of the scapula Teres major Because the long thoracic nerve passes down the lateral thoracic wall on the external surface of the serratus anterior muscle, just deep to skin and subcutaneous fascia, it is vulnerable to damage. Loss of function of this muscle causes the medial border, and particularly the inferior angle, of the scapula to elevate away from Latissimus dorsi the thoracic wall, resulting in characteristic “winging” of the scapula, on pushing forward with the arm. Furthermore, normal elevation at the arm is no longer possible. Fig. 7.44 Lateral wall of the axilla.

In the clinic Breast cancer Lymphatic drainage from the lateral part of the breast passes through nodes in the axilla. Significant disruption to the normal lymphatic drainage of the upper limb may occur if a mastectomy or a surgical axillary nodal clearance has been carried out for breast cancer. Furthermore, some patients have radiotherapy to the axilla to prevent the spread of metastatic disease, but a side effect of this is the destruction of the tiny lymphatics as well as the cancer cells. If the lymphatic drainage of the upper limb is damaged, the arm may swell and pitting edema (lymphedema) may develop.

In the clinic Rupture of biceps tendon It is relatively unusual for muscles and their tendons to rupture in the upper limb; however, the tendon that most commonly ruptures is the tendon of the long head of the biceps brachii muscle. In isolation, this has relatively little effect on the upper limb, but it does produce a characteristic deformity—on flexing the elbow, there is an extremely prominent bulge of the muscle belly as its Lateral head of triceps brachii unrestrained fibers contract—the “Popeye” sign.

It is important Radial groove of humerus to determine the site of the rupture, whether it’s at the Long head of triceps brachii musculotendinous junction, midtendon, or at the insertion because this will determine the surgical approach for Medial head of triceps brachii repair. Brachialis The brachialis muscle originates from the distal half of Lateral head of triceps brachii the anterior aspect of the humerus and from adjacent parts of the intermuscular septa, particularly on the medial side (Fig. 7.64 and Table 7.8). It lies beneath the biceps brachii Olecranon muscle, is flattened dorsoventrally, and converges to form a tendon, which attaches to the tuberosity of the ulna. The brachialis muscle flexes the forearm at the elbow joint. Innervation of the brachialis muscle is predominantly by the musculocutaneous nerve. A small component of the lateral part is innervated by the radial nerve. Fig. 7.65 Triceps muscle.

In the clinic Construction of a dialysis fistula Ulnar artery Fistula Radial artery Many patients throughout the world require renal dialysis for kidney failure. The patient’s blood is filtered and cleaned by the dialysis machine. Blood therefore has to be taken from patients into the filtering device and then returned to them. This process of dialysis occurs over many hours and requires considerable flow rates of 250–500 mL per minute. To enable such large volumes of blood to be removed from and returned to the body, the blood is taken from vessels that have a high flow. As no veins in the peripheral limbs have such high flow, a surgical procedure is necessary to create such a system. In most patients, the radial artery is anastomosed (joined) to the cephalic vein (Fig. 7.78) at the A B wrist, or the brachial artery is anastomosed to the cephalic vein at the elbow. Some surgeons place an arterial graft Radial artery Draining vein between these vessels.

The distal end of the ulna is small and characterized by a rounded head and the ulnar styloid process (Fig. 7.81). The anterolateral and distal part of the head is covered by Oblique cord articular cartilage. The ulnar styloid process originates from the posteromedial aspect of the ulna and projects distally. Ulna In the clinic Interosseous membrane Fractures of the radius and ulna The radius and ulna are attached to the humerus proximally and the carpal bones distally by a complex series of ligaments. Although the bones are separate, they behave as one. When a severe injury occurs to the Aperture for anterior forearm it usually involves both bones, resulting in either Radius interosseous artery fracture of both bones or more commonly a fracture of one bone and a dislocation of the other. Commonly, the Distal radio-ulnar joint mechanism of injury and the age of the patient determine Articular disc which of these are likely to occur. Wrist joint There are three classic injuries to the radius and ulna: ■ Monteggia’s fracture is a fracture of the proximal third of the ulna and an anterior dislocation of the head of the radius at the elbow. ■ Galeazzi’s fracture is a fracture of the distal third of the radius associated with subluxation (partial dislocation) of the head of the ulna at the wrist joint. ■ Colles’ fracture is a fracture, and posterior displacement, of the distal end of the radius. Whenever a fracture of the radius or ulna is demonstrated radiographically, further images of the elbow and wrist should be obtained to exclude dislocations. Joints Fig. 7.82 Distal radio-ulnar joint and the interosseous membrane. Distal radio-ulnar joint The distal radio-ulnar joint occurs between the articular surface of the head of the ulna, with the ulnar notch on the end of the radius, and with a fibrous articular disc, radius associated with subluxation (partial dislocation) of the head of the ulna at the wrist joint. ■ Colles’ fracture is a fracture, and posterior displacement, of the distal end of the radius.

Joints Fig. 7.82 Distal radio-ulnar joint and the interosseous membrane. Distal radio-ulnar joint The distal radio-ulnar joint occurs between the articular surface of the head of the ulna, with the ulnar notch on the end of the radius, and with a fibrous articular disc, which separates the radio-ulnar joint from the wrist joint 764 (Fig. 7.82). --- Page 789 --- 7 Regional Anatomy • Forearm The triangular-shaped articular disc is attached by its posterior compartments. The orientation of fibers in the apex to a roughened depression on the ulna between the membrane is also consistent with its role in transferring styloid process and the articular surface of the head, and forces from the radius to the ulna and ultimately, therefore, by its base to the angular margin of the radius between the from the hand to the humerus. ulnar notch and the articular surface for the carpal bones.

Lunate The flexor retinaculum is a thick connective tissue liga- ment that bridges the space between the medial and lateral sides of the base of the arch and converts the carpal arch into the carpal tunnel. The four tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus, the four tendons of the flexor digitorum superficialis, and the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus pass through the carpal tunnel, as does the median nerve (Fig. 7.98). The flexor retinaculum holds the tendons to the bony plane at the wrist and prevents them from “bowing.” Free movement of the tendons in the carpal tunnel is facilitated by synovial sheaths, which surround the tendons. All the tendons of the flexor digitorum profundus and flexor digitorum superficialis are surrounded by a single synovial sheath; a separate sheath surrounds the tendon of the flexor pollicis longus. The median nerve is anterior to the tendons in the carpal tunnel. The tendon of the flexor carpi radialis is surrounded by a synovial sheath and passes through a tubular compart- ment formed by the attachment of the lateral aspect of the flexor retinaculum to the margins of a groove on the medial side of the tubercle of the trapezium.

Abduction of the humerus at the glenohumeral joint is initiated by the supraspinatus muscle. After the shoulder has Deltoid muscle been abducted to 10°–15°, the deltoid muscle continues the movement. The patient was able to abduct her arm by lowering and tilting the glenohumeral joint inferiorly to enable the deltoid to obtain its mechanical advantage. The loss of muscle bulk in the supraspinous fossa suggested muscle atrophy. Muscle atrophy occurs when a muscle is not used. The orthopedic surgeon thought that there was a tear of the supraspinatus tendon beneath the acromion. If this was so, the muscle would atrophy.

Gentle exercise and physiotherapy were performed and the patient returned to playing baseball. The MRI demonstrated a divot in the posterosuperior aspect of the humeral head and a small fragment of bone and glenoid labrum that had become separated in the anteroinferior aspect of the glenoid cavity. Shoulder dislocation is not an uncommon problem and may occur as a “once-off” or with repetitive injury may be recurrent. Recurrent dislocations may be bilateral and symmetrical (a memory aid is “torn loose or born loose”). The MRI findings are typical for an anteroinferior dislocation, which is the most common type; moreover the MRI demonstrates the injuries that occur within the joint at the time of dislocation. These injuries include the abutment of the posterosuperior aspect of the humeral head on the anteroinferior aspect of the glenoid cavity. This type of injury, when recurrent, may avulse a small fragment of the glenoid labrum, and in some cases this may attach to a small fragment of bone (the Bankart lesion). When the shoulder is relocated, the integrity of the capsular attachment anteroinferiorly has been disrupted, potentially making the shoulder somewhat prone to further dislocation. An arthroscopic repair was performed. eFig. 7.129 The moreover the MRI demonstrates the injuries that occur within the joint at the time of dislocation.

Larynx and pharynx The neck contains two specialized structures associated with the digestive and respiratory tracts—the larynx and pharynx. The larynx (Fig. 8.6) is the upper part of the lower airway and is attached below to the top of the trachea and above, by a flexible membrane, to the hyoid bone, which in Posterior turn is attached to the floor of the oral cavity. A number of cartilages form a supportive framework for the larynx, Vertebral compartment which has a hollow central channel. The dimensions of Fig. 8.5 Major compartments of the neck.

This can result in an irregular head shape because the pattern and direction of skull growth are altered. In the majority of cases the cause is unknown, and in a minority of cases it may be caused by a genetic syndrome. In the clinic Medical imaging of the head Ultrasonography Radiography It is now possible to carry out intracranial Doppler studies, Until recently, the standard method of imaging the head was which enable a surgeon to detect whether a patient is plain radiography.

Currently, skull radiographs are used in cases of acoustic window through the fontanelles. trauma, but such use is declining. Skull fractures are relatively easily detected (Fig. 8.29). The patient is assessed and treatment is based upon the underlying neurological or potential neurological complications. Skull fracture Computed tomography Since the development of computed tomography (CT), cerebral CT has become the “workhorse” of neuroradiological examination. It is ideally used for head injury because the brain and its coverings can be easily and quickly examined and blood is easily detected. By altering the mathematical algorithm of the data set the bones can also be demonstrated. With intravenous contrast, CT angiography can be used to demonstrate the position and the size of an intracerebral aneurysm before endovascular treatment. Magnetic resonance imaging Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is unsurpassed by other imaging techniques in its ability for contrast resolution. The brain and its coverings, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and vertebral column can be easily and quickly examined. Newer imaging sequences permit CSF suppression to define periventricular lesions. Magnetic resonance angiography has been extremely useful in determining the completeness of the intracranial Fig. 8.29 Skull fracture seen on a skull radiograph (patient in vasculature (circle of Willis), which is necessary in some supine position). surgical conditions.

Venous drainage Emissary vein Diploic vein Venous drainage of the brain begins internally as networks Dura mater of small venous channels lead to larger cerebral veins, Cerebral vein Dural venous sinus Skull cerebellar veins, and veins draining the brainstem, which eventually empty into dural venous sinuses. The dural venous sinuses are endothelial-lined spaces between the outer periosteal and the inner meningeal layers of the dura mater, and eventually lead to the internal jugular veins. Also emptying into the dural venous sinuses are diploic veins, which run between the internal and external tables of compact bone in the roof of the cranial cavity, and emissary veins, which pass from outside the cranial cavity to the dural venous sinuses (Fig. 8.43). The emissary veins are important clinically because they can be a conduit through which infections can enter the cranial cavity because they have no valves.

Under pressure, the blood progressively separates dura from the bone. 3 Tear to cerebral vein where it crosses dura to enter cranial venous sinus can result in subdural hematoma. The tear separates a thin layer of meningeal dura from that which remains attached to the periosteal layer. As a result, the hematoma is covered by an inner limiting membrane derived from part of the meningeal dura. 4 Aneurysm • Ruptured aneurysms of vessels of the cerebral arterial circle hemorrhage directly into the subarachnoid space and CSF. 878 Fig. 8.47 Scalp and meninges. --- Page 906 --- 8 Regional Anatomy • Brain and Its Blood Supply In the clinic Head injury deceleration forces within the brain.

Extradural hemorrhage An extradural hemorrhage (Fig. 8.48) is caused by arterial damage and results from tearing of the branches of the middle meningeal artery, which typically occurs in the region of the pterion. Blood collects between the periosteal layer of the dura and the calvaria and under arterial pressure slowly expands. The typical history is of a blow to the head (often during a sporting activity) that produces a minor loss of consciousness. Following the injury the patient usually regains consciousness and has a lucid interval for a period of hours. After this, rapid drowsiness and unconsciousness ensue, which may lead to death.

The diagnosis of concussion, MTBI, is based on the event, the current neurological status, and the state of consciousness of the patient. In the clinic Clinical assessment of patients with head injury Clinical assessment of patients with head injury always appears relatively straightforward. In reality it is usually far from straightforward. Patients may have a wide spectrum of modes of injury from a simple fall to complex multiple trauma. The age of the patient and ability to communicate about the injuries are important factors. The circumstances in which the injury may have occurred should be documented because some head injuries result from a serious assault, and the physician may be required to give evidence to a court of law. Determining the severity of head injury may be difficult because some injuries occur as a result of or in association with alcohol intoxication. Even when the diagnosis has been made and the correct management has been instigated, the circumstances in which the injury occurred and the environment to which the patient will return after treatment need to be reviewed to prevent further injuries (e.g., an elderly person tripping Fig. 8.51 MRI of the brain shows peripherally enhancing on loose carpet on a staircase). tuberculosis lesions in the left temporal lobe and cerebral peduncle. A thorough clinical examination includes all systems, but with a special focus on the central and peripheral nervous systems. The level of consciousness must also be assessed and accurately documented using the Glasgow Coma Scale, which allows clinicians to place a numerical value upon the level of consciousness so that any deterioration or improvement can be measured and quantified. Glasgow Coma Scale The Glasgow Coma Scale was proposed in 1974 and is now In the clinic widely accepted throughout the world.

Any new space-occupying lesion, such as a hematoma, an injury that leads to brain swelling, or a brain tumor, can increase intracranial pressure and compress the brain. In severe cases, the brain may be squeezed down into the foramen magnum, giving it a cone shape, termed cerebral herniation, or “coning.” This may in turn compress the brainstem and upper cervical spinal cord, which can be fatal. Congenital herniation or coning of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum can also occur if the posterior fossa is too small, a condition known as Chiari I malformation (Fig. 8.52). This often causes no problems in childhood and may only start causing symptoms in adulthood.

The parotid gland produces a watery saliva and salivary amylase, which are necessary for food bolus formation, oral digestion, and smooth passage of the bolus into the upper gastrointestinal tract. Tumors of the parotid gland The commonest tumors of the parotid gland (Fig. 8.63) are benign and typically involve the more superficial part of the gland. These include pleomorphic adenoma and adenolymphoma. Their importance is in relation to their anatomical position. The relationship of any tumor to the branches of the facial nerve [VII] must be defined because resection of the tumor may damage the nerve. Parotid gland stones It is not uncommon for stones to develop within the parotid gland. They typically occur within the main confluence of the ducts and within the main parotid duct. The patient usually complains of intense pain when salivating and tends to avoid foods that produce this symptom. The pain can be easily reproduced in the clinic by squirting lemon juice into the patient’s mouth. Surgery depends upon where the stone is. If it is within the anterior aspect of the duct, a simple incision in the buccal mucosa with a sphincterotomy may allow removal. If Styloid process Right jugular vein Tumor in the stone is farther back within the main duct, complete left parotid gland gland excision may be necessary. Fig. 8.63 Tumor in parotid gland.

This often debilitating condition may be so severe that patients are confined to their home for fear of embarrassment. Treatment is relatively straightforward. The patient is anesthetized and a bifurcate endotracheal Infratrochlear nerve tube is placed into the left and right main bronchi. A small Supratrochlear nerve incision is made in the intercostal space on the appropriate Supra-orbital nerve side, and a surgically induced pneumothorax is created. The patient is ventilated through the contralateral lung. Using an endoscope the apex of the thoracic cavity can be viewed from inside and the cervicothoracic ganglion readily identified. Obliterative techniques include thermocoagulation and surgical excision. After the Lacrimal nerve ganglion has been destroyed, the endoscope is removed, the lung is reinflated, and the small hole is sutured.

This provides a connection between the Modiolus perilymph-containing cochlea and the subarachnoid space (Fig. 8.131). Scala vestibuli Membranous labyrinth Cochlear duct The membranous labyrinth is a continuous system of Scala ducts and sacs within the bony labyrinth. It is filled with tympani endolymph and separated from the periosteum that covers the walls of the bony labyrinth by perilymph. Consisting of two sacs (the utricle and the saccule) and four ducts (the three semicircular ducts and the cochlear duct), the membranous labyrinth has unique functions related to balance and hearing: Lamina of modiolus Cochlear nerve Spiral ganglion ■ The utricle, saccule, and three semicircular ducts are part of the vestibular apparatus (i.e., organs of balance).

Sensory receptors Functionally, sensory receptors for balance are organized into unique structures that are located in each of the components of the vestibular apparatus. In the utricle and saccule the sense organ is the macula of the utricle and the macula of the saccule, respectively, and in the ampulla of each of the three semicircular ducts it is the crista.

In most cases it involves excision of part or most of the thyroid gland. This surgical procedure is usually carried out for benign diseases, such as multinodular goiter and thyroid cancer. Given the location of the thyroid gland, there is a possibility of damaging other structures when carrying out a thyroidectomy, namely the parathyroid glands and the recurrent laryngeal nerve (Fig. 8.181). Assessment of the vocal folds is necessary before and after thyroid surgery because the recurrent laryngeal nerves are closely related to ligaments that bind the gland to the larynx and can be easily traumatized during surgical procedures.

Nasal vein in foramen cecum The superior labial artery originates from the facial artery near the lateral end of the oral fissure and passes Drainage to cavernous medially in the lip, supplying the lip and giving rise to sinus in cranial cavity branches that supply the nose and nasal cavity. An alar branch supplies the region around the lateral aspect of the naris and a septal branch passes into the nasal cavity and supplies anterior regions of the nasal septum. The lateral nasal artery originates from the facial artery in association with the margin of the external nose and contributes to the blood supply of the external nose. Alar branches pass around the lateral margin of the naris and supply the nasal vestibule. Anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries The anterior and posterior ethmoidal arteries (Fig. 8.243) originate in the orbit from the ophthalmic artery, which originates in the cranial cavity as a major branch of the internal carotid artery. They pass through canals in the medial wall of the orbit between the ethmoidal labyrinth Drainage to facial vein Drainage to pterygoid plexus and frontal bone, supply the adjacent paranasal sinuses, in infratemporal fossa and then enter the cranial cavity immediately lateral and superior to the cribriform plate.

He came to the emergency department with double vision. The double vision was only in one plane. Examination of the orbits revealed that when the patient was asked to look upward the right eye was unable to move superiorly when adducted. There was some limitation in general eye movement. Assessment of the lateral rectus muscle (abducent nerve [VI]), superior oblique muscle (trochlear nerve [IV]), and the rest of the eye muscles (oculomotor nerve [III]) was otherwise unremarkable. The patient underwent a CT scan. A CT scan of the facial bones demonstrated a fracture through the floor of the orbit (Fig. 8.293). A careful review of this CT scan demonstrated that the inferior oblique muscle had been pulled inferiorly with the fragment of bone in the fracture. This produced a tethering effect, so when the patient was asked to gaze in the upward Right Left direction, the left eye was able to do so but the right eye Fracture and inferior oblique muscle was unable to because of the tethered inferior oblique muscle.

This swelling was associated with considerable pain, which was provoked by the ingestion of lemon sweets. On examination he had tenderness around the right parotid region and a hard nodule was demonstrated in the buccal mucosa adjacent to the right upper molar teeth. A diagnosis of parotid duct calculus was made. The formation of stones in the salivary glands is not uncommon, but it is more likely in the submandibular gland than in the parotid gland because the saliva is more mucinous and the duct has a long upward course from the floor of the mouth. Nevertheless, stones do form in the parotid gland and the parotid ducts.

The lesion is in the area of the optic chiasm. Any disruption of the optic chiasm produces the field defect of bitemporal hemianopia. Tumors of the optic chiasm are unusual, though gliomas do occur. More frequently, compression of the optic chiasm by tumors in the vicinity is the usual cause for bitemporal hemianopia. A pituitary tumor was diagnosed. The optic chiasm is anterior and extremely close to the pituitary gland. Given that the patient is producing excessive amounts of prolactin (a pituitary tumor) and there is loss of the function of the chiasm, the most likely clinical explanation is an exophytic pituitary tumor compressing the optic chiasm. An MRI scan was performed and demonstrated a large tumor (macroadenoma) of the pituitary gland. Drug treatment was commenced and the tumor shrank Pituitary gland Optic chiasm 1121.e4 (eFig. 8.295).

Anteriorly, the cerebellum forms the roof of the lobe fourth ventricle (eFig. 9.14). On its surface, the cerebellum has several convoluted folds, or folia, separated by fissures. Two of these fissures serve as landmarks to divide the cerebellum into three lobes. Superiorly, the primary fissure separates the anterior lobe from the posterior lobe (eFig. 9.61). Anteriorly and inferiorly, the posterolateral fissure defines the structures of the flocculonodular lobe, which includes the flocculus from each hemisphere and nodule of the vermis (eFig. 9.63). A third fissure, the horizontal fissure, Superior borders the superior and inferior surfaces of the cerebellum Hemisphere vermis (eFig. 9.64). Each fold or folia of the cerebellar cortex has a central core of white matter covered by a thin layer of gray matter superficially. In sections parallel to the median plane, the branching pattern of the folia can be appreciated; this is often referred to as the arbor vitae (eFig. 9.28).

Tunnel of Corti CENTRAL AUDITORY PATHWAYS Stereocilium The first-order axons entering the brainstem from the cochlea terminate ipsilaterally on the dorsal and ventral cochlear nuclei. From here, second-order axons have several synaptic targets. Second-order axons forming the ascending auditory pathway ascend to the pons and project bilaterally on the superior olivary nucleus (eFig. 9.82). These bilateral projec- tions are important for auditory acuity and localizing the origin of a sound. From here, fibers continue to ascend as the lateral lemniscus and terminate in the inferior colliculus of the midbrain. Axons leaving the inferior colliculus then have a synaptic relay in the medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus before reaching the final synaptic target: the primary auditory cortex (superior temporal gyrus) of the temporal lobe (eFig. 9.82). Throughout this pathway, from OCB Ribbon synapse OCB the basilar membrane to the primary auditory cortex, audi- tory stimuli are tonotopically represented.
