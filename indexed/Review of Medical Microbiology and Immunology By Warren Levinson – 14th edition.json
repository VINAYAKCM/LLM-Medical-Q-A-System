The cocci are by a cell membrane, not a cell wall). Some bacteria have round, the bacilli are rods, and the spirochetes are spiral- surface features external to the cell wall, such as a capsule, shaped. Some bacteria are variable in shape and are said to be pleomorphic (many-shaped). The shape of a bacterium is determined by its rigid cell wall. The microscopic appearance of a bacterium is one of the most important criteria used in its identification. In addition to their characteristic shapes, the arrange- ment of bacteria is important. For example, certain cocci A-1 A-2 A-3 A-4 occur in pairs (diplococci), some in chains (streptococci), and others in grapelike clusters (staphylococci). These arrangements are determined by the orientation and degree of attachment of the bacteria at the time of cell division. The arrangement of rods and spirochetes is medically less important and is not described in this introductory B-1 B-2 B-3 B-4 B-5 chapter. Bacteria range in size from about 0.2 to 5 μm (Figure 2–2). The smallest bacteria (Mycoplasma) are about the same size as the largest viruses (poxviruses) and are the smallest organisms capable of existing outside a host. The longest C-1 C-2 bacteria rods are the size of some yeasts and human red FIGURE 2–1 Bacterial morphology. A: Cocci in clusters (e.g., blood cells (7 μm).

Obtain a specimen from the infected site. 2. Stain the specimen using the appropriate procedure (e.g., Gram stain or acid-fast stain). If bacteria are seen in the Gram stain specimen, their shape (e.g., cocci or rods), size, arrangement (e.g., chains or clusters), and whether they are gram-positive or gram-negative should be observed. It is also important to determine whether only one or more than one type of bacteria is present. The microscopic appearance is not sufficient to speciate an organism, but it often allows an educated guess to be made regarding the genus of the organism and thereby guides empiric therapy. 3. Culture the specimen on the appropriate media (e.g., blood agar plates). In most instances, the plates should be streaked in such a manner to obtain isolated colonies (i.e., a “pure culture”). The plates should be incubated in the presence or absence of oxygen as appropriate. 4. Identify the organism using the appropriate tests (e.g., sugar fermentation, DNA probes, antibody-based tests such as agglutination, or immunofluorescence). Note special features such as hemolysis and pigment formation. 5. Perform antibiotic susceptibility tests.

Detect antibody in the patient’s serum. Detection of immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibody indicates a current infection. A fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer between the acute serum sample and the convalescent serum sample also indicates a current infection. (A major drawback with the use of acute and convalescent serum samples is that the convalescent sample is usually taken 10–14 days after the acute sample. By this time, the patient has often recovered and the diagnosis becomes a retrospective one.) A single IgG antibody titer is difficult to interpret because it is unclear whether it represents a current or a previous infection. In certain diseases, a single titer of sufficient magnitude can be used as presumptive evi- dence of a current infection. 2. Detect antigen in the patient’s specimen. Use known antibody to detect presence of antigens of the organisms (e.g., fluorescent antibody to detect antigens in tissue, latex agglutination to detect capsular polysaccharide antigens in spinal fluid). 3. Detect nucleic acids in the patient’s specimen. Use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA probes to detect the DNA or RNA of the organism. mebooksfree.com --- Page 74 ---"

For example, in S. aureus, transpeptidation occurs between the amino group on the end of the pentaglycine cross-link and the terminal carboxyl group of the d-alanine on the tetra- peptide side chain. Because the stereochemistry of penicil- lin is similar to that of a dipeptide, d-alanyl-d-alanine, Bacteriostatic penicillin can bind to the active site of the transpeptidase drug removed and inhibit its activity. Two additional factors are involved in the action of penicillin: (1) The first is that penicillin binds to a variety of recep- tors in the bacterial cell membrane and cell wall, called penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs).

Top: The patient’s organism is added to tubes containing decreasing amounts of the antibiotic. After incubation at 37°C overnight, growth of the bacteria is observed visually. The lowest concentration of drug that inhibits growth (i.e., 3.1 μg/mL) is the MIC. However, at this point, it is not known whether the bacteria have been killed or whether the drug has only inhibited their growth. Bottom: To determine whether that concentration of drug is bactericidal (i.e., to determine its MBC), an aliquot (0.1 mL) from the tubes is plated on an agar plate that does not contain any drug. The concentration of drug that inhibits at least 99.9% of the bacterial colonies (i.e., 6.2 μg/mL) is the MBC. Minimal Bactericidal Concentration For certain infections, such as endocarditis, it is important to know the concentration of drug that actually kills the organ- ism rather than the concentration that merely inhibits growth. Antibiotic Bacterial This concentration, called the minimal bactericidal concen- disks growth tration (MBC), is determined by taking a small sample Zone of (0.01 or 0.1 mL) from the tubes used for the MIC assay and growth spreading it over the surface of a drug-free blood agar plate inhibition (Figure 11–2). Any organisms that were inhibited but not N killed now have a chance to grow because the drug has been C Au diluted significantly. After incubation at 35°C for 48 hours, the lowest concentration that has reduced the number of colonies by 99.9%, compared with the drug-free control, is P S the MBC. Bactericidal drugs usually have an MBC equal or very similar to the MIC, whereas bacteriostatic drugs usually have an MBC significantly higher than the MIC. Te Cl Serum Bactericidal Activity 0 1 2 3 4 5 In the treatment of endocarditis, it can be useful to deter- mine whether the drug is effective by assaying the ability of the drug in the patient’s serum to kill the organism.

Two of the most important human pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes, are described in this chapter. Staph- ylococci and streptococci are nonmotile and do not form spores. Both staphylococci and streptococci are gram-positive cocci, but they are distinguished by two main criteria: (1) Microscopically, staphylococci appear in grapelike clusters, whereas streptococci are in chains. (2) Biochemically, staphylococci produce catalase (i.e., FIGURE 15–1 Abscess on foot.

CA-MRSA is a very common cause of community-acquired staphylococcal infections. Almost all strains of CA-MRSA produce P-V leukocidin (see later) whereas relatively few strains of HCA-MRSA do so. The most common strain of MRSA in the United States is the “USA300” strain. Strains of S. aureus with intermediate resistance to van- comycin (VISA) and with full resistance to vancomycin (VRSA) have also been detected. The cassette of genes that encodes vancomycin resistance in S. aureus is the same as the cassette that provides vancomycin resistance in entero- cocci. These genes are located in a transposon on a plasmid and encode the enzymes that substitute d-lactate for d-alanine in the peptidoglycan. S. aureus has several important cell wall leukocidin (see later) whereas relatively few strains of HCA-MRSA do so. The most common strain of MRSA in the United States is the “USA300” strain.

These genes are located in a transposon on a plasmid and encode the enzymes that substitute d-lactate for d-alanine in the peptidoglycan. S. aureus has several important cell wall components and antigens: (1) Protein A is the major protein in the cell wall. It is an important virulence factor because it binds to the Fc portion of IgG at the complement-binding site, thereby preventing the activation of complement. As a conse- quence, no C3b is produced, and the opsonization and FIGURE 15–6 Coagulase test—Upper tube inoculated with phagocytosis of the organisms are greatly reduced.

They are usually bacitracin-resistant. They hydrolyze (break down) hippurate, an important diagnostic criterion. Group D streptococci include enterococci (e.g., E. faeca- lis and Enterococcus faecium) and nonenterococci (e.g., S. bovis). Enterococci are members of the normal flora of the colon and are noted for their ability to cause urinary, biliary, and cardiovascular infections. They are very hardy organisms; they can grow in hypertonic (6.5%) saline or in bile and are not killed by penicillin G. As a result, a syner- gistic combination of penicillin and an aminoglycoside (e.g., gentamicin) is required to kill enterococci. Vancomy- cin can also be used, but vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) have emerged and become an important and much feared cause of life-threatening nosocomial infections.

Poststreptococcal (Nonsuppurative) Diseases These are disorders in which a local infection with group A streptococci is followed weeks later by inflammation in an organ that was not infected by the streptococci. The inflam- mation is caused by an immunologic (antibody) response to streptococcal M proteins that cross-react with human tissues. Some strains of S. pyogenes bearing certain M pro- teins are nephritogenic and cause AGN, and other strains bearing different M proteins are rheumatogenic and cause acute rheumatic fever. Note that these diseases appear sev- eral weeks after the actual infection because that is the length of time it takes to produce sufficient antibodies.

The toxin affects all eukaryotic cells regardless of tissue type but has no effect on the analo- gous factor in prokaryotic cells. The toxin is a single polypeptide with two functional domains. The binding (B) domain mediates binding of the toxin to glycoprotein receptors on the cell membrane. The active (A) domain possesses enzymatic activity that cleaves nicotinamide from nicotinamide adenine dinucle- otide (NAD) and transfers the remaining ADP-ribose to EF-2, thereby inactivating it. Other organisms whose exotoxins act by ADP-ribosylation are described in Tables 7–10 and 7–11. The DNA that codes for diphtheria toxin is part of the DNA of a temperate bacteriophage called beta phage. During the lysogenic phase of viral growth, the DNA of this virus integrates into the bacterial chromosome and the toxin is synthesized. Corynebacterium diphtheriae cells that are not lysogenized by this phage do not produce exotoxin and are nonpathogenic. FIGURE 17–7 Diphtheria.

Struvite stones often manifest, as staghorn calculi in the renal pelvis. They obstruct urine flow, damage urinary epithelium, and serve as a nidus for recurrent infection by trapping bacteria within the stone. Because alkaline urine also favors growth of the organisms and more extensive renal damage, treatment involves keeping the urine at a low pH. Clinical Findings The signs and symptoms of urinary tract infections caused by these organisms cannot be distinguished from those caused by E. coli or other members of the Enterobacteria- ceae.

It causes 10% to 20% of hospital-acquired infections and, in many hospitals, is the most common cause of gram-negative nosocomial pneumonia, especially ventilator-associated pneumonia. Pathogenesis is based on multiple virulence factors: endotoxin, exotoxins, and enzymes. Its endotoxin, like that of other gram-negative bacteria, causes the symptoms of sepsis and septic shock. The best known of the exotoxins is exotoxin A, which causes tissue necrosis. It inhibits eukary- otic protein synthesis by the same mechanism as diphtheria exotoxin, namely, ADP-ribosylation of elongation factor-2. It also produces enzymes, such as elastase and proteases that are histotoxic and facilitate invasion of the organism into the bloodstream. Pyocyanin damages the cilia and mucosal cells of the respiratory tract. FIGURE 18–7 Ecthyma gangrenosum.

These organisms cause a variety of infections, such as (Figure 18–8). local abscesses at the site of a mucosal break, metastatic abscesses by hematogenous spread to distant organs, or lung abscesses by aspiration of oral flora. Predisposing factors such as surgery, trauma, and chronic disease play an important role in pathogenesis. Local tissue necrosis, impaired blood supply, and growth of facultative anaerobes at the site contribute to anaerobic infections. The facultative anaerobes, such as E. coli, utilize the oxygen, thereby reducing it to a level that allows the anaerobic Bacteroides and Prevotella strains to grow. As a result, many anaerobic infections contain a mixed faculta- tive and anaerobic flora. This has important implications for therapy; both the facultative anaerobes and the anaer- obes should be treated. The polysaccharide capsule of B. fragilis is an important virulence factor. The host response to the capsule plays a major role in abscess formation. Note also that the endo- toxin of B. fragilis contains a variant lipid A that is missing one of the fatty acids and consequently is 1000-fold less active than the typical endotoxin of bacteria such as Neis- seria meningitidis. 7B. fragilis is divided into five subspecies, the most important of FIGURE 18–8 Prevotella melaninogenica—black pigmented which is B. fragilis subsp. fragilis.

The rapid onset of fever, headache, and stiff neck, along with drowsi- ness, is typical. Sinusitis and otitis media cause pain in the affected area, opacification of the infected sinus, and red- ness with bulging of the tympanic membrane. Hemophilus influenzae is second only to the pneumococcus as a cause of these two infections. Other serious infections caused by this organism include septic arthritis, cellulitis, and sepsis, the latter occurring especially in splenectomized patients.

            "content": "Gram-Negative Rods Related to Animal Sources (Zoonotic Organisms) 181 The pathogenesis of angiomas that occur in Bartonella infections in immunocompromised individuals is uncer- tain. One current explanation is that infection of endothe- lial cells by Bartonella induces the synthesis of angiogenesis factor that causes endothelial cells to proliferate. Clinical Findings In immunocompetent people, B. henselae causes cat- scratch disease (CSD). This disease is characterized by fever and tender, enlarged lymph nodes, typically on the same side as the scratch (Figure 20–1). A papule at the site of the scratch may precede the lymphadenopathy. CSD has a prolonged course but eventually resolves, even with- out antibiotics. A small percentage of those infected develop systemic disease, such as endocarditis or encephalitis. In immunocompromised individuals, especially patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), B. henselae causes bacillary angiomatosis (BA). BA is charac- terized by raised, cherry-red vascular lesions in the skin and visceral organs (Figure 20–2). The lesions appear pap- ular or nodular. Bacillary peliosis (peliosis hepatis) is simi- lar to bacillary angiomatosis except that in peliosis, the lesions occur primarily in the liver and spleen. FIGURE 20–2 Bacillary angiomatosis. Note the cherry-red hemangioma-like skin lesion. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K, Johnson R. Fitzpatrick’s Color Atlas & Synopsis of Clinical Dermatology. 6th ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2009. Copyright © 2009 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.) Laboratory Diagnosis The diagnosis of CSD is usually made serologically. Anti- bodies against B. henselae antigens can be detected in a patient’s serum by a variety of immunologic tests. The organism can be cultured on artificial media but takes 5 days or longer to grow and so is not usually done. The diagnosis of BA is often made by finding pleomorphic rods in biopsy tissue using the Warthin-Starry silver stain. Pathologic examination of tissue from the lesion will distinguish bacil- lary angiomatosis from Kaposi’s sarcoma. Treatment No antibiotic therapy is typically recommended for CSD. If the patient has severe lymphadenitis, azithromycin is the drug of choice. Treatment of BA with doxycycline or eryth- romycin is effective. There is no significant antibiotic resistance.

A positive skin test reverts to negative in about 5% to 10% of people. Reversion to negative is more common in the United States now than many years ago because now a person is less likely to be exposed to the organism and therefore less likely to receive a boost to the immune system. The skin test itself does not induce a positive response in a person who has not been exposed to the organism. It can, however, “boost” a weak or negative response in a person who has been exposed to produce a positive reaction. The clinical implications of this “booster effect” are beyond the scope of this book. Tuberculin reactivity is mediated by the cellular arm of the immune system; it can be transferred by CD4-positive T cells but not by serum.

Clinical Findings The typical lesion of actinomycosis appears as a hard, non- tender swelling that develops slowly and eventually drains pus through sinus tracts (Figure 22–2). Hard, yellow gran- ules (sulfur granules) composed of a mass of filaments are formed in pus. In about 50% of cases, the initial lesion involves the face and neck; in the rest, the chest or abdomen is the site. Pelvic actinomycosis can occur in women who have retained an intrauterine device for a long period of time. Actinomyces israelii and Arachnia species are the most common causes of actinomycosis in humans. The disease is not communicable. Laboratory Diagnosis Diagnosis in the laboratory is made by (1) seeing gram- positive branching rods, especially in the presence of sulfur granules; and (2) seeing growth when pus or tissue speci- mens are cultured under anaerobic conditions.

Clinical Findings Nocardia asteroides typically causes either pneumonia, lung abscess with cavity formation, lung nodules, or empyema. From the lung, the organism can spread to various organs, notably the brain, where it causes brain abscess. Disease occurs most often in immunocompromised individuals, especially those with reduced cell-mediated immunity. Nocardia brasiliensis, a different species of Nocardia, causes skin infections in the southern regions of the United States and mycetoma, usually in tropical regions. Laboratory Diagnosis Diagnosis in the laboratory involves (1) seeing branching rods or filaments that are gram-positive (see Figure 22–1) or weakly acid-fast in an acid-fast stain and (2) seeing aero- bic growth on bacteriologic media in a few days. Treatment & Prevention Treatment is with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Surgical drainage may also be needed. Occasional drug resistance occurs. No vaccine or prophylactic drug is available.

Both specific antitreponemal antibody and nonspecific reagin are used in the serologic diagnosis of syphilis. Transmission & Epidemiology Treponema pallidum is transmitted from spirochete- containing lesions of skin or mucous membranes (e.g., genitalia, mouth, and anus) of an infected person to other persons by intimate contact. It can also be transmitted from pregnant women to their fetuses. Rarely, blood for transfusions collected during early syphilis is also infec- tious. Treponema pallidum is a human organism only. There is no animal reservoir. Syphilis occurs worldwide, and its incidence is increas- ing. It is one of the leading notifiable diseases in the United FIGURE 24–1 Treponema pallidum—dark field microscopy. States. Many cases are believed to go unreported, which The coiled form of this spirochete is in the center of the field. (Source: limits public health efforts.

The organism often infects the endothelium of small blood vessels, causing endarteritis. This occurs dur- ing all stages of syphilis but is particularly important in the TREPONEMA pathogenesis of the brain and cardiovascular lesions seen in tertiary syphilis. 1. Treponema pallidum In primary syphilis, the spirochetes multiply at the site Disease of inoculation, and a local, nontender ulcer (chancre) usu- ally forms in 2 to 10 weeks (Figure 24–2). The ulcer heals Treponema pallidum causes syphilis. Important Properties Treponema pallidum has not been grown on bacteriologic media or in cell culture. Nonpathogenic treponemes, which are part of the normal flora of human mucous membranes, can be cultured. Treponema pallidum grows very slowly. The medical importance of that fact is that antibiotics must be present at an effective level for several weeks to kill the organisms and cure the disease (see “Treatment” section later). For exam- ple, benzathine penicillin is the form of penicillin used to treat primary and secondary syphilis because the penicillin is released very slowly from this depot preparation, and bactericidal concentrations are present for weeks after administration of the antibiotic. The antigens of T. pallidum induce specific antibodies, which can be detected by immunofluorescence or hemag- glutination tests in the clinical laboratory. They also induce nonspecific antibodies (reagin),1 which can be detected by FIGURE 24–2 Chancre of primary syphilis. Note the shallow ulcer with a rolled edge (red arrow) that is typical of a syphilitic chan- cre. (Reproduced with permission from Wolff K, Johnson R.

The presence of any sexually transmitted disease makes testing for syphilis mandatory, because several different infections are often transmitted simultaneously. There is no vaccine against syphilis. 2. Nonvenereal Treponematoses These are infections caused by spirochetes that are virtually indistinguishable from those caused by T. pallidum. They are endemic in populations and are transmitted by direct contact. All these infections result in positive (nontrepone- mal and treponemal) results on serologic tests for syphilis. None of these spirochetes have been grown on bacterio- logic media. The diseases include bejel in Africa, yaws (caused by T. pallidum subspecies pertenue) in many humid tropical countries, and pinta (caused by Treponema cara- teum) in Central and South America. All can be cured by penicillin. BORRELIA Borrelia species are irregular, loosely coiled spirochetes that stain readily with Giemsa and other stains.

The major bacterial diseases transmit- ted by ticks in the United States are Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, anaplasmosis, relaps- ing fever, and tularemia. Ixodes scapularis ticks transmit three diseases: two bacterial diseases, Lyme disease and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, and the protozoan dis- ease, babesiosis. Coinfection with B. burgdorferi and Babe- sia occurs, especially in endemic areas such as Massachusetts and other northeastern states. Pathogenesis Pathogenesis is associated with spread of the organism from the bite site through the surrounding skin followed by dissemination via the blood (bacteremia) to various organs, especially the heart, joints, and central nervous system. No FIGURE 24–6 Ixodes scapularis—”blacklegged” tick. Engorged exotoxins, enzymes, or other important virulence factors female tick after feeding. (Source: Dr. Gary Alpert, Centers for Disease Control have been identified. and Prevention.) Note that the organism must adapt to two markedly dif- ferent hosts, the tick and the mammal (either mice or humans). It does so by changing its outer surface protein (OSP). These OSPs vary antigenically within humans. Multiple episodes of Lyme disease are due to reinfection, rather than relapse caused by reactivation of the organism. There is no evidence for a latent stage of B. burgdorferi. Clinical Findings The clinical findings have been divided into three stages; however, this is a progressive disease, and the stages are not discrete. In stage 1 (early localized stage), the most com- mon finding is erythema chronicum migrans (also called erythema migrans), an expanding, erythematous, macular rash that often has a “target” or “bull’s eye” appearance (Figure 24–8). The rash appears between 3 and 30 days after the tick bite. Both the tick bite and the rash are painless and nonpruritic.

The latter undergoes repeated cycles of binary fission to form daughter reticulate bodies, which then develop into elementary bodies, which are released from the cell. Within cells, the site of replication appears as an inclusion body in the cytoplasm, which can be stained and visualized microscopically (Figure 25–2). These inclusions are useful in the identification of these organisms in the clinical laboratory. All chlamydiae share a group-specific lipopolysaccha- ride antigen, which is detected by complement fixation tests.

The cleavage of the Gag-Pol precursor polyprotein by the virion protease occurs in the immature virion after it has budded out from the cell membrane. The cleavage produces the capsid protein (p24), the matrix protein (p17), and enzymes such as the reverse transcriptase and the integrase.

Initially, Virus 1 (Blue capsid proteins and vertical genome) and Virus 2 (Yellow capsid proteins and horizontal genome) infect the same mouse cell. Assume that Virus 1 can infect human cells but not chicken cells (a property determined by the blue surface proteins) and that Virus 2 can infect chicken cells but not human cells (a property determined by the yellow surface proteins). However, both Virus 1 and Virus 2 can infect a mouse cell. Within the mouse cell, both genomes are replicated and both blue and yellow capsid proteins are synthesized. As shown, some of the progeny virus (Viruses 3 and 4) exhibit phenotypic mixing because they have both the blue and the yellow surface proteins and therefore can infect both chicken cells and human cells. Note that in the next round of infection, when progeny Virus 3 infects either human cells or chicken cells, the progeny of that infection (Viruses 5 and 6) is determined by the vertical genome and will be identical to Virus 1 with only blue capsid proteins and a vertical genome. Similarly (but not shown), when progeny Virus 4 infects either human cells or chicken cells, the progeny of that infection is determined by the horizontal genome and will be identical to Virus 2.

Interferons act by binding to a receptor on the cell surface that signals the cell to synthesize three proteins, thereby inducing the “antiviral state” (Figure 33–2). These Inhibits protein synthesis three proteins are inactive precursor proteins until they are activated by double-stranded RNA synthesized during viral replication. As a result, these proteins are active in virus- infected cells but not in uninfected cells.

Interferon binds to the surface of the uninfected cell and induces three proteins that remain inactive until a virus infects the kinase that phosphorylates an initiation factor (eIF-2) for cell. These proteins are oligo A synthetase, ribonuclease, and protein protein synthesis, thereby inactivating it. The end result is kinase. When a virus infects that cell, a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is that both viral and cellular protein synthesis is inhibited synthesized as part of the viral replicative cycle.

Not all virus infections induce antibodies. Tolerance to viral antigens can occur when the virus infection develops in a fetus or newborn infant. The model system in which tolerance has been demonstrated is lympho- cytic choriomeningitis (LCM) infection in mice. If LCM virus is inoculated into a newborn mouse, the virus replicates widely, but no antibodies are formed during the lifetime of the animal. The virus is recognized as “self,” because it was present at the time of maturation of the immune system. If LCM virus is given to an adult mouse, antibodies are formed normally. There is no example of total tolerance to a virus in humans; even in congenital rubella syndrome, in which the virus infects the fetus, some antibody against rubella virus is made. However, virus production and shedding can go on for months or years. Suppression of the cell-mediated response can occur during infection by certain viruses.

FIGURE 35–4 Acyclovir (ACV) is phosphorylated to ACV-MP very effectively by herpesvirus-encoded thymidine kinase but very poorly by cell-encoded thymidine kinase. The thymidine kinases encoded by herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1, HSV-2, and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are par- ticularly active on ACV; the thymidine kinases encoded by cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus are not. This accounts for the selective action of ACV in cells infected by HSV-1, HSV-2, and VZV.

All herpesviruses are structurally similar. Each has an icosahedral core surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope (Figure 37–1). The genome is linear double-stranded DNA. The virion does not contain a polymerase. They are large (120–200 nm in diameter), second in size only to poxviruses. They replicate in the nucleus, form intranuclear inclu- sions, and are the only viruses that obtain their envelope by budding from the nuclear membrane. The virions of her- pesviruses possess a tegument located between the nucleo- capsid and the envelope. This structure contains regulatory proteins, such as transcription and translation factors, which play a role in viral replication. Herpesviruses are noted for their ability to cause latent infections. In these infections, the acute disease is followed by an asymptomatic period during which the virus remains in a quiescent (latent) state. When the patient is exposed to an inciting agent or immunosuppression occurs, reactivation FIGURE 37–1 Herpes simplex virus (HSV)—electron micrograph. of virus replication and disease can occur.1 With some Three HSV virions are visible.

Also, the CMV genome encodes a protein and an RNA that have the ability to inhibit apoptosis in infected cells. Inhibition of apoptosis allows the infected cell to survive. Three of the herpesviruses, HSV types 1 and 2 and var- icella-zoster virus (VZV), cause a vesicular rash, both in primary infections and in reactivations. Primary infections are usually more severe than reactivations. The other two herpesviruses, CMV and Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), do not cause a vesicular rash. Four herpesviruses, namely HSV types 1 and 2, VZV, and CMV, induce the formation of multinucleated giant cells, which can be seen microscopically in the lesions. The importance of giant cells is best illustrated by the Tzanck smear, which reveals multinucleated giant cells in a smear taken from the painful vesicles of the genitals caused by HSV type 2 (Figure 37–2).

Fever, headache, vom- iting, seizures, and altered mental status are typical clinical features. The onset may be acute or protracted over several days. The disease occurs as a result of either a primary infection or a recurrence. Magnetic resonance imaging often reveals the lesion. Examination of the spinal fluid typically shows a moderate increase of lymphocytes, a moderate elevation in the amount of protein, and a normal amount of glucose. HSV-1 encephalitis has a high mortality rate and causes severe neurologic sequelae in those who survive. (5) Herpetic whitlow is a pustular lesion of the skin of the finger or hand. It can occur in medical personnel as a result of contact with patient’s lesions. (6) Herpes gladiatorum, as the name implies, occurs in wrestlers and others who have close body contact. It is caused primarily by HSV-1 and is characterized by vesicu- lar lesions on the head, neck, and trunk. (7) Eczema herpeticum (Kaposi’s varicelliform erup- tion) is an infection of the skin of a patient with atopic dermatitis. Vesicular lesions are seen at the site of the atopic dermatitis (eczema). Most cases occur in children. (8) Disseminated infections, such as esophagitis and pneumonia, occur in immunocompromised patients with depressed T-cell function.

Multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions are seen in the base of the lesions. The virus infects sensory neurons and is carried by retro- grade axonal flow into the cells of the dorsal root ganglia, where the virus becomes latent. In latently infected cells, VZV DNA is located in the nucleus and is not integrated into cellular DNA. Later in life, frequently at times of reduced cell-mediated immunity or local trauma, the virus is activated and causes the vesicu- lar skin lesions and nerve pain of zoster. Immunity following varicella is lifelong: A person gets varicella only once, but zoster can occur despite this immu- nity to varicella. Zoster usually occurs only once.

The rash evolves the major rare complications, occurring more often in adults. Reye’s syndrome, characterized by encephalopathy and liver degeneration, is associated with VZV and influ- enza B virus infection, especially in children given aspirin. Its pathogenesis is unknown. Zoster The occurrence of painful vesicles along the course of a sensory nerve of the head or trunk is the usual picture (Figure 37–6). The pain can last for weeks, and post- zoster neuralgia (also known as postherpetic neuralgia) can be debilitating. In immunocompromised patients, life-threatening disseminated infections such as pneu- monia can occur. Laboratory Diagnosis Although most diagnoses are made clinically, laboratory tests are available. A presumptive diagnosis can be made by using the Tzanck smear. Multinucleated giant cells are seen in VZV as well as HSV lesions (see Figure 37–2). The definitive diagnosis is made by isolation of the virus in cell culture and identification with specific antiserum. A rise in antibody titer can be used to diagnose varicella but is less useful in the diagnosis of zoster.

When this protein is released from CMV- infected cells, the protein binds to chemokines thereby preventing the chemokines from serving as a signal for host immune cells to migrate to the site of CMV infection. CMV infection causes an immunosuppressive effect by inhibiting T cells. Host defenses against CMV infection include both circulating antibody and cell-mediated immunity. Cellular immunity is more important, because its suppression can lead to systemic disease. Clinical Findings Approximately 20% of infants infected with CMV during gestation show clinically apparent manifestations of cyto- megalic inclusion disease such as microcephaly, seizures, FIGURE 37–7 Cytomegalovirus—owl’s eye inclusion body. deafness, jaundice, and purpura.

HUMAN HERPESVIRUS 8 (KAPOSI’S SARCOMA–ASSOCIATED HERPESVIRUS) In 1994, it was reported that a new herpesvirus, now known as human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), or Kaposi’s sar- coma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV), causes Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS), the most common cancer in patients with AIDS. The idea that a virus other than HIV is the cause of KS arose from epidemiologic data showing that KS was common in patients who acquired HIV sexually but rare in patients who acquired HIV via blood transfusion. A second virus transmitted sexually appeared likely to be the cause. The initial evidence that HHV-8 was involved was the finding that most KS cells taken from AIDS patients con- tain the DNA of this virus, but tissues taken from AIDS patients without KS had very little viral DNA. The DNA of this virus was also found in KS cells that arose in non–HIV- infected patients. On DNA analysis, HHV-8 resembles the lymphotropic herpesviruses (e.g., EBV and herpesvirus saimiri) more than it does the neurotropic herpesviruses, FIGURE 37–10 Kaposi’s sarcoma—note several dark purple such as HSV and VZV. lesions on the foot caused by human herpesvirus 8 (Kaposi’s Additional support was provided by serologic studies sarcoma–associated virus).

To protect the unimmunized general popu- lation, the concept of “ring vaccination” will be used.

Therefore, if an attack occurs, people known to be exposed will be immunized as well as the direct contacts of those people and then the contacts of the contacts, in an expanding ring.

Many species of animals are infected with their own types of papillomaviruses, but these viruses are not an important source of human infection.

The hemag- glutinin functions at the beginning of infection, whereas the neuraminidase functions at the end. Neuraminidase also degrades the protective layer of mucus in the respira- tory tract. This enhances the ability of the virus to gain access to the respiratory epithelial cells. Influenza viruses, especially influenza A virus, show changes in the antigenicity of their hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins; this property contributes to their capacity to cause devastating worldwide epidemics (pan- demics). There are two types of antigenic changes: (1) antigenic shift, which is a major change based on the reas- sortment of segments of the genome RNA; and (2) anti- genic drift, which is a minor change based on mutations in the genome RNA. Note that in reassortment, entire seg- ments of RNA are exchanged, each one of which codes for a single protein (e.g., the hemagglutinin) (Figure 39–2). Influenza A virus has two matrix proteins: The M1 matrix protein is located between the internal nucleopro- tein and the envelope and provides structural integrity. The FIGURE 39–1 Influenza virus—electron micrograph. Long M2 matrix protein forms an ion channel between the arrow points to the helical nucleocapsid of influenza virus.

As a result, virus virus innate defenses are reduced and viral virulence is corre- spondingly enhanced. Many species of animals (e.g., aquatic birds, chickens, swine, and horses) have their own influenza A viruses. These animal viruses are the source of the RNA segments that encode the antigenic shift variants that cause epidem- ics among humans. For example, if an avian and a human influenza A virus infect the same cell (e.g., in a farmer’s respiratory tract), reassortment could occur and a new Lung cell variant of the human A virus, bearing the avian virus hem- agglutinin, may appear (see Figure 39–1). Reassortment of There is evidence that aquatic birds (waterfowl) are a RNA genome segments common source of these new genes and that the reassort- ment event leading to new human strains occurs in pigs. In other words, pigs may serve as the “mixing bowl” within which the human, avian, and swine viruses reassort. There are 16 types of hemagglutinin (H1 to H16) and 9 types of neuraminidase (N1 to N9) found in waterfowl. In humans, three types of hemagglutinin (H1, H2, and H3) and two types of neuraminidase (N1 and N2) predominate. New strain Because influenza B virus is only a human virus, there is of influenza virus no animal source of new RNA segments. Influenza B virus therefore does not undergo antigenic shifts.

            "content": "). have a severe, life-threatening disease when they contract measles. Pathogenesis & Immunity After infecting the cells lining the upper respiratory tract, the virus enters the blood and infects reticuloendothelial cells, where it replicates again. It then spreads via the blood to the skin. The rash is caused primarily by cytotoxic T cells attacking the measles virus–infected vascular endo- thelial cells in the skin. Antibody-mediated vasculitis may also play a role. Shortly after the rash appears, the virus can no longer be recovered and the patient can no longer spread the virus to others. Multinucleated giant cells, which form as a result of the fusion protein in the spikes, are characteristic of the lesions. Lifelong immunity occurs in individuals who have had the disease. Although IgG antibody may play a role in neu- tralizing the virus during the viremic stage, cell-mediated immunity is more important. The importance of cell- mediated immunity is illustrated by the fact that agamma- globulinemic children have a normal course of disease, are subsequently immune, and are protected by immunization. Maternal antibody passes the placenta, and infants are pro- tected during the first 6 months of life. Infection with measles virus can transiently depress cell-mediated immunity against other intracellular micro- organisms, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, leading to a loss of purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test reactivity, reactivation of dormant organisms, and clinical disease.

The vaccine is effective and long-lasting (at least 10 years) and causes few side effects. Two immuniza- tions are recommended, one at 15 months and a booster dose at 4 to 6 years, usually in combination with measles and rubella vaccines. Because it is a live vaccine, it should not be given to immunocompromised persons or pregnant women. Immune globulin is not useful for preventing or mitigating mumps orchitis. In the late 1980s, outbreaks of mumps occurred in both immunized and unimmunized people. This led to the recommendation in 1989 that a second course of the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine be adminis- tered. The incidence of mumps fell, and outbreaks did not occur until 2006, when 6584 cases occurred, primarily in college-age individuals who, surprisingly, had received two doses of the vaccine. Waning immunity after the sec- ond dose and immunization with a different genotype from the genotype that caused the outbreak are suggested explanations. In 2009 and again in 2014, outbreaks of mumps occurred in young adults including those who had received two doses of vaccine.

FILOVIRUSES There are two important filoviruses that cause human disease: Ebola virus and Marburg virus. Filoviruses are long filamentous (filo = thread) viruses. They are the lon- gest viruses, often measuring thousands of nanometers (Figure 39–7). EBOLA VIRUS Disease Ebola virus causes Ebola hemorrhagic fever (EHF). The virus is named for the river in Zaire that was the site of the first known outbreak of EHF in 1976. A devastating epidemic of EHF occurred in several West African coun- tries, especially Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea in 2014–2015. FIGURE 39–7 Ebola virus—electron micrograph.

(1) The vaccine (e.g., Recombivax) contains HBsAg produced in yeasts by recombinant DNA techniques. The vaccine is highly effective in preventing hepatitis B and has few side effects. The seroconversion rate is approximately 95% in healthy adults. It is indicated for people who are frequently exposed to blood or blood products, such as certain health care personnel (e.g., medical students, sur- geons, and dentists), patients receiving multiple transfu- sions or dialysis, patients with frequent sexually transmitted disease, and abusers of illicit intravenous drugs. Travelers who plan a long stay in areas of endemic infection, such as many countries in Asia and Africa, should receive the vac- cine. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends that all newborns and adolescents receive the vaccine. At present, booster doses after the initial three-dose regi- men are not recommended. However, if antibody titers have declined in immunized patients who are at high risk, such as dialysis patients, then a booster dose should be considered. Widespread immunization with the HBV vaccine has significantly reduced the incidence of hepatocellular carci- noma in children. A vaccine called Twinrix that contains both HBsAg and inactivated HAV provides protection against both hepatitis B and hepatitis A. (2) Hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) contains a high titer of HBsAb. It is used to provide immediate, passive pro- tection to individuals known to be exposed to HBsAg- positive blood (e.g., after an accidental needle-stick injury). Precise recommendations for use of the vaccine and HBIG are beyond the scope of this book. However, the HBsAg Total anti-HBc recommendation regarding one common concern of medi- cal students, the needle-stick injury from a patient with HBsAg-positive blood, is that both the vaccine and HBIG Level of be given (at separate sites).

The main immune response to HIV infection consists of cytotoxic CD8-positive lymphocytes. These cells respond to the initial infection and control it for many years. Mutants of HIV, especially in the env gene encoding gp120, arise, but new clones of cytotoxic T cells proliferate and control the mutant strain. It is the ultimate failure of these cytotoxic T cells that results in the clinical picture of AIDS. Cytotoxic T cells lose their effectiveness because so many CD4 helper T cells have died; thus the supply of lym- phokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), required to activate the cytotoxic T cells is no longer sufficient. There is evidence that “escape” mutants of HIV are able to proliferate unchecked because the patient has no clone of cytotoxic T cells capable of responding to the mutant strain. Furthermore, mutations in any of the genes encod- ing class I MHC proteins result in a more rapid progression to clinical AIDS. The mutant class I MHC proteins cannot present HIV epitopes, which results in cytotoxic T cells being incapable of recognizing and destroying HIV- infected cells. slevel evitaleR ACUTE IMMUNODEFICIENCY CD4 lymphocytes Anti-p24 antibodies Anti-gp120 antibodies Virus, viral RNA, p24 antigen 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 3 – ≥ 10 Time after infection (mo) Time after infection (y) FIGURE 45–5 Time course of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Fungi do not have endotoxin in their cell walls and do not produce bacterial-type exotoxins. Activation of the cell-mediated immune system results in a delayed hypersensitivity skin test response to certain fungal antigens injected intradermally. A positive skin test indicates exposure to the fungal antigen. It does not imply current infection, because the exposure may have occurred in the past. A negative skin test makes the diagnosis unlikely unless the patient is immunocompromised. Because most people carry Candida as part of the normal A B C flora, skin testing with Candida antigens can be used to determine whether cell-mediated immunity is normal. The transmission and geographic locations of some important fungi are described in Table 47–2.

The disease is typically named for the affected body part (i.e., tinea capitis [head], tinea cor- poris [body], tinea cruris [groin], and tinea pedis [foot]) (Figure 48–1). Tinea unguium, also called onychomycosis, is a disease of the nails, especially toe nails. The nails become thickened, broken, and discolored. Trichophyton tonsurans is the most common cause of out- breaks of tinea capitis in children and is the main cause of endothrix (inside the hair) infections. Trichophyton rubrum is also a very common cause of tinea capitis. Trichophyton schoenleinii is the cause of favus, a form of tinea capitis in which crusts are seen on the scalp. Trichophyton species also cause an inflammatory pustular lesion on the scalp called a kerion. The marked inflammation is caused by an intense T-cell–mediated reaction to the presence of the fungus.

Asthma caused by the inhalation of airborne conidia, espe- cially in certain occupational settings, also occurs. MUCOR & RHIZOPUS Aspergillus flavus growing on cereals or nuts produces aflatoxins that may be carcinogenic or acutely toxic. Mucormycosis (zygomycosis, phycomycosis) is a disease caused by saprophytic molds (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus, and Absidia) found widely in the environment. They are not dimorphic. These organisms are transmitted by airborne asexual spores and invade tissues of patients with reduced host defenses. They proliferate in the walls of blood vessels, particularly of the paranasal sinuses, lungs, or gut, and cause infarction and necrosis of tissue distal to the blocked vessel (Figure 50–13). Patients with diabetic ketoacidosis, burns, bone mar- row transplants, or leukemia are particularly susceptible. Diabetic patients are particularly susceptible to rhinocere- bral mucormycosis, in which mold spores in the sinuses germinate to form hyphae that invade blood vessels that supply the brain. One species, Rhizopus oryzae, causes about 60% of cases of mucormycosis.

The oval cyst is thick-walled with four nuclei and several internal fibers. Each cyst gives rise to two trophozoites during excystation in the intestinal tract. FIGURE 51–4 Entamoeba histolytica—cyst. Arrow points to a cyst of E. histolytica. Two of the four nuclei are visible just to the left of Pathogenesis & Epidemiology the head of the arrow.

The morphology and life cycle of the two species are similar. The vector for both is the tsetse fly, Glossina, but different species of fly are involved for each. Humans are the reservoir for T. gambiense, whereas T. rhodesiense has reservoirs in both domestic animals (especially cattle) and wild animals (e.g., antelopes). The 3-week life cycle in the tsetse fly begins with inges- tion of trypomastigotes in a blood meal from the reservoir host. They multiply in the insect gut and then migrate to the salivary glands, where they transform into epimasti- gotes, multiply further, and then form metacyclic trypo- mastigotes, which are transmitted by the tsetse fly bite.

Reduced bone marrow activity, coupled with cellular destruction in the spleen, results in anemia, leukopenia, and thrombocytopenia. This leads to secondary infections and a tendency to bleed. The striking enlargement of the spleen is due to a combina- tion of proliferating macrophages and sequestered blood FIGURE 52–14 Leishmania donovani—amastigotes. Arrow cells.

ACANTHAMOEBA & NAEGLERIA Acanthamoeba castellanii and Naegleria fowleri are free- living amebas that cause meningoencephalitis. The organ- isms are found in warm freshwater lakes and in soil. Their life cycle involves trophozoite and cyst stages. Cysts are quite resistant and are not killed by chlorination. Naegleria trophozoites usually enter the body through mucous membranes while an individual is swimming. They can penetrate the nasal mucosa and cribriform plate to produce a purulent meningitis and encephalitis that are usually rapidly fatal (Figure 53–1).

The principal sites of tissue reaction are the lungs, where inflammation with an eosinophilic exudate occurs in response to larval antigens. Because the adults derive their nourishment from ingested food, a heavy worm burden may contribute to malnutrition, especially in children in developing countries. Most infections are asymptomatic. Ascaris pneumonia with fever, cough, and eosinophilia can occur with a heavy larval burden. Abdominal pain and even obstruction can result from the presence of adult worms in the intestine.

ANCYLOSTOMA & NECATOR Disease Ancylostoma duodenale (Old World hookworm) and Necator americanus (New World hookworm) cause hookworm infection. Important Properties The life cycle of the hookworms is shown in Figure 56–9. Humans are infected when filariform larvae in moist soil penetrate the skin, usually of the feet or legs (Figures 56–2E and 56–10). They are carried by the blood to the lungs, migrate into the alveoli and up the bronchi and tra- chea, and then are swallowed.

Disease Strongyloides stercoralis causes strongyloidiasis. Important Properties The life cycle of S. stercoralis is shown in Figure 56–13. S. stercoralis has two distinct life cycles, one within the human body and the other free-living in the soil. The life cycle in the human body begins with the penetration of the skin, usually of the feet, by infectious (filariform) lar- vae (see Figures 56–2I and 56–10) and their migration to the lungs. They enter the alveoli, pass up the bronchi and trachea, and then are swallowed. In the small intestine, the larvae molt into adults (see Figure 56–2H) that enter the mucosa and produce eggs. The eggs usually hatch within the mucosa, forming rhabditiform larvae (see Figure 56–2J) that are passed in the feces. Some larvae molt to form filariform larvae, which penetrate the intestinal wall directly without leaving the host and migrate to the lungs (autoinfection). Filariform larvae can also exit the anus and reinfect through the peri- anal skin. In immunocompetent patients, this is an infre- quent, clinically unimportant event. However, in immunocompromised patients (e.g., those who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS] or are taking high-dose corticosteroids or TNF inhibitors) or patients who are severely malnourished, autoinfection can lead to massive reinfection (hyperinfection), with larvae passing to many organs and with severe, sometimes fatal consequences. Reinfection can also occur in those infected Some larvae molt to form filariform larvae, which penetrate the intestinal wall directly without leaving the host and migrate to the lungs (autoinfection). Filariform larvae can also exit the anus and reinfect through the peri- anal skin. In immunocompetent patients, this is an infre- quent, clinically unimportant event.

Reinfection can also occur in those infected with human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV) because their ability to mount a protective T-cell response is diminished. If larvae are passed in the feces and enter warm, moist soil, they molt through successive stages to form adult male and female worms.

(1) Helper T cells and macrophages are our main defense against intracellular bacteria, such as M. tuberculosis, and fungi, such as Histoplasma capsulatum. (2) Cytotoxic T cells are an important defense against viruses and act by destroying virus-infected cells.

In the primary response, immunoglobulin (Ig) M is the first type of antibody to appear. In the secondary response, IgG appears earlier and shows a more rapid rise and a higher final concentration than in the primary response. If at the time of the second exposure to the antigen (Ag1), a second, non–cross-reacting antigen (Ag2) was injected, a primary response to Ag2 would occur while a secondary response to Ag1 was occurring. higher levels than the primary response. This is attributed to the persistence of antigen-specific “memory cells” after the first contact. These memory cells proliferate to form a large clone of specific B cells and plasma cells, which medi- ate the secondary antibody response. During the secondary response, the amount of IgM produced is similar to that after the first contact with antigen. However, a much larger amount of IgG antibody is produced, and the levels tend to persist much longer than in the primary response. With each succeeding exposure to the antigen, the anti- bodies tend to bind antigen more firmly. Antibody binding improves because mutations occur in the DNA that encodes the antigen-binding site, a process called somatic hyper- mutation. Some mutations result in the insertion of differ- ent amino acids in the hypervariable region that result in a better fit and cause the antigen to be bound more strongly. The subset of plasma cells with these improved hypervari- able regions are more strongly (and more frequently) selected by antigen and therefore constitute an increasingly larger part of the population of antibody-producing cells. This process is called affinity maturation. One important effect of booster doses of vaccines is to improve antibody binding by enhancing the affinity maturation process. Affinity maturation occurs in the germinal centers of the follicles in the spleen and lymph nodes. Follicle den- dritic cells capture antigen–antibody complexes on their surface via Fc receptors. The complexes interact with an activated B cell bearing the immunoglobulin that best fits the antigen, and it is that B cell that is stimulated to form a clone of many B cells capable of synthesizing the improved antibody. RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE ANTIGENS ADMINISTERED SIMULTANEOUSLY When two or more antigens are administered at the same time, the host reacts by producing antibodies to all of them. ydobitna fo tnuomA IgG IgG IgM IgM 0 7 14 21 28 35 Competition of antigens for antibody-producing mecha- nisms occurs experimentally but appears to be of little sig- nificance in medicine. Combined immunization is widely used (e.g., the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis [DTP] vaccine or the measles, mumps, rubella [MMR] vaccine). FUNCTION OF ANTIBODIES The primary function of antibodies is to protect against infectious agents or their products (see Table 59–2). Anti- bodies provide protection because they can (1) neutralize toxins and viruses and (2) opsonize microorganisms. Opsonization is the process by which antibodies make microorganisms more easily ingested by phagocytic cells. This occurs by either of two reactions: (1) the Fc portion of IgG interacts with its receptors on the phagocyte surface to facilitate ingestion or (2) IgG or IgM activates complement to yield C3b, which interacts with its and pertussis [DTP] vaccine or the measles, mumps, rubella [MMR] vaccine).

Anti- bodies provide protection because they can (1) neutralize toxins and viruses and (2) opsonize microorganisms. Opsonization is the process by which antibodies make microorganisms more easily ingested by phagocytic cells. This occurs by either of two reactions: (1) the Fc portion of IgG interacts with its receptors on the phagocyte surface to facilitate ingestion or (2) IgG or IgM activates complement to yield C3b, which interacts with its receptors on the sur- face of the phagocyte. Antibodies can be induced actively in the host or acquired passively and are thus immediately available for defense. In medicine, passive immunity is used in the neu- tralization of the toxins of diphtheria, tetanus, and botu- lism by antitoxins and in the inhibition of such viruses as rabies and hepatitis A and B viruses early in the incubation period. ANTIBODIES IN THE FETUS Antibodies in the fetus are primarily IgG acquired by trans- fer of maternal IgG across the placenta. Some antibodies can be made by the fetus if infection occurs, such as in congenital syphilis. Newborn infants can make IgG (and other isotypes, such as IgM and IgA) to certain protein antigens. For example, the vaccine against hepatitis B that contains hepatitis B surface antigen is effective when given to newborns. After birth, maternal IgG declines and pro- tection from maternal IgG is lost by 3 to 6 months. mebooksfree.com --- Page 544 ---"

Diagnosis of infectious diseases • When the organism cannot be cultured (e.g., syphilis and hepatitis A, B, and C). • When the organism is too dangerous to culture (e.g., rickettsial diseases). • When culture techniques are not readily available (e.g., HIV, EBV). • When the organism takes too long to grow (e.g., Mycoplasma). One problem with this approach is that it takes time for antibodies to form (e.g., 7–10 days in the primary response). For this reason, acute and con- valescent serum samples are taken, and a fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer is required to make a diagnosis. By this time, the patient has often recovered and the diagnosis becomes a retrospective one. If a test is available that can detect IgM antibody in the patient’s serum, it can be used to make a diagnosis of current infection. In certain infectious diseases, an arbitrary IgG antibody titer of sufficient magnitude is used to make a diagnosis. II. Diagnosis of autoimmune diseases • Antibodies against various normal body components are used (e.g., antibody against DNA in systemic lupus erythematosus, antibody against human IgG [rheumatoid factor] in rheumatoid arthritis). III. Determination of blood type and HLA type • Known antibodies are used to determine ABO and Rh blood types. • Known antibodies are used to determine class I and class II HLA proteins prior to transplantation, although DNA sequencing is also being used. EBV = Epstein–Barr virus; HIV = human immunodeficiency virus; HLA = human leukocyte antigen. 546 mebooksfree.com --- Page 558 ---"

Microorganisms and other cells possess a variety of antigens and thus induce antisera containing many differ- ent antibodies (i.e., the antisera are polyclonal). Monoclo- nal antibodies excel in the identification of antigens because cross-reacting antibodies are absent (i.e., monoclonal anti- bodies are highly specific). TYPES OF DIAGNOSTIC TESTS Many types of diagnostic tests are performed in the immu- nology laboratory. Most of these tests can be designed to determine the presence of either antigen or antibody. To do this, one of the components, either antigen or antibody, is known and the other is unknown. For example, with a known antigen such as influenza virus, a test can determine whether antibody to the virus is present in the patient’s serum. Alter- Zone of Zone of natively, with a known antibody, such as antibody to herpes antibody equivalence excess simplex virus, a test can determine whether viral antigens are present in cells taken from the patient’s lesions. Increasing antigen concentration Agglutination In this test, the antigen is particulate (e.g., bacteria and red blood cells)1 or is an inert particle (latex beads) coated with an antigen. Antibody, because it is divalent or multivalent, cross-links the antigenically multivalent particles and forms a latticework, and clumping (agglutination) can be seen. This reaction can be done in a small cup or tube or with serum.

Increasing antigen concentration Agglutination In this test, the antigen is particulate (e.g., bacteria and red blood cells)1 or is an inert particle (latex beads) coated with an antigen. Antibody, because it is divalent or multivalent, cross-links the antigenically multivalent particles and forms a latticework, and clumping (agglutination) can be seen. This reaction can be done in a small cup or tube or with a drop on a slide. One very commonly used agglutination test is the test that determines a person’s ABO blood group (Figure 64–1; see the section on blood groups at the end of this chapter). Precipitation (Precipitin) In this test, the antigen is in solution. The antibody cross- links antigen molecules in variable proportions, and aggre- gates (precipitates) form. In the zone of equivalence, optimal proportions of antigen and antibody combine; the maximal amount of precipitates forms, and the supernatant contains neither an excess of antibody nor an excess of antigen (Figure 64–2). In the zone of antibody excess, there is too much antibody for efficient lattice formation, and precipitation is less than maximal.2 In the zone of anti- A B gen excess, all antibody has combined, but precipitation is reduced because many antigen–antibody complexes are too FIGURE 64–1 Agglutination test to determine ABO blood small to precipitate (i.e., they are “soluble”). type.

If agglutination had occurred in the right side as well, it would indicate that the patient was producing B antigen as well as A and was type AB. 2 The term “prozone” refers to the failure of a precipitate or flocculate to form because too much antibody is present. For example, a false-negative serologic test for syphilis (VDRL) is occasionally reported because the 1 When red cells are used, the reaction is called hemagglutination. antibody titer is too high.

In the zones of antibody excess and antigen excess, a lattice is not formed and precipitation does not occur, whereas in the equiva- lence zone, a lattice forms and precipitation is maximal.

Close to the antigen-containing well, a zone of antigen excess exists and no precipitate forms; close to the antibody-containing well, a zone of antibody excess exists and no precipitate forms. A and B are unrelated antigens (i.e., they have no epit- opes in common). B and C are related antigens (i.e., they have some epitopes in common but some that are different). For example, chicken lysozyme (well B) and duck lysozyme (well C) share some epitopes because they are both lysozymes but have unique epitopes as well because they are from different species. The line of identity between B and C is caused by the reaction of the anti-B antibody with the shared epitopes on antigens B and C. The spur pointing toward well 4 is caused by the reaction of some of the anti-B antibody with the unique epitopes on anti- gen B in well 3. These lines of partial identity occur because antibody to B (chicken lysozyme) is polyclonal and has some immunoglobulins that react with the epitopes common to chicken and duck lysozyme and other immunoglobulins that react only with the epitopes unique to chicken lysozyme.

The black widow spider is about 1 cm in length with a characteristic orange-red hourglass on its ventral surface (Figure 69–10). The brown recluse spider is also about 1 cm in length, but has a characteristic violin-shaped pattern on its dorsal surface (Figure 69–11). It is also called the “fiddleback” spider. Neurotoxic Disease The bite of the black widow spider causes neurologic symp- toms primarily. Within an hour after the bite, pain and numbness spread from the site.

Recovery of a pathogen often requires a pericardiocentesis or pericardial biopsy. Treatment Treatment for infectious pericarditis is dependent on the pathogen. Most viral etiologies are treated with symptom- atic management and supportive care, whereas bacterial, mycobacterial, and fungal infections will require directed antimicrobial therapy. In patients with constrictive pericar- ditis and tamponade, pericardiocentesis can be life-saving. Untreated bacterial pericarditis is rapidly fatal. Prevention Immunization against S. pneumoniae may be effective. Treatment of early or latent stages of infections (e.g., tuber- culosis) may prevent development of pericarditis in some cases.

Altered mental status also commonly occurs. If untreated, meningitis may progress to vomiting, seizures, photophobia, and focal neurologic deficits. Different pathogens can pres- ent with different rates of clinical progression, from acute onset and rapid progression (hours to days) to subacute or chronic onset and slow progression (days to weeks). Neisseria meningitidis infection can be associ- ated with disseminated disease (meningococcemia) and result in petechial rash and ultimately purpura fulmi- nans (Figure 72–3). Pathogens Acute Bacterial Pathogens The most common bacterial cause of acute meningitis overall is S. pneumoniae. However, Streptococcus agalactiae (group B Streptococcus) predominates in neonates, and N. meningitidis is common in teenagers and young adults (Table 72–2). Haemophilus influenzae type B used to be an important cause in young children, but the widespread use of the conjugate polysaccharide vaccine has greatly decreased its incidence. Listeria monocytogenes is reason- ably common in the very young, the very old, and in immu- nocompromised patients. Less common pathogens include Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme disease) and Treponema pallidum (syphilis). Acute Viral Pathogens The most common viral causes of acute meningitis are enteroviruses such as Coxsackie virus and echovirus. Enteroviral meningitis occurs primarily in young chil- dren, and the peak incidence is in the summer and fall FIGURE 72–1 Purulent meningitis. Note film of greenish pus in seasons.

Sometimes both the brain and the meninges are involved, a condition called meningoencephalitis. Pathophysiology The mode of acquisition of the viruses that cause encepha- litis varies (Table 72–3). Neonates acquire HSV-2 during passage through the birth canal. HSV-2 then reaches the brain by hematogenous spread. Mothers with visible vesic- ular lesions are much more likely to have newborns with serious HSV-2 infections than mothers who are asymptom- atic shedders of HSV-2 because the amount of virus present is significantly greater in the former. In contrast, HSV-1 probably reaches the temporal lobe by travel down sensory neurons following activation of latent infection in the trigeminal ganglion (Figure 72–4). Rabies virus also reaches the brain by axonal travel from the site of the animal bite. Arboviruses, such as WNV, are acquired primarily by mosquito bite and then travel to the brain via the blood- stream. The incidence of arboviral encephalitis peaks in the summer and early fall because that is when mosquitoes are most active. FIGURE 72–4 Encephalitis caused by herpes simplex virus-1.

ENTERIC FEVER SUCH Diarrhea or constipation may be present. If perforation AS TYPHOID FEVER occurs, patients can present with generalized peritoneal signs with diffuse abdominal pain and shock. Definition Enteric fever is a clinical syndrome comprised of constitu- tional symptoms, such as fever and headache, and nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Although enteric fever can be caused by several Salmonella species, “typhoid fever” refers to enteric fever caused by the Salmonella typhi. S. typhi is also known as Salmonella enterica serotype Typhi. Typhoid fever is a significant global health problem. Pathophysiology Following the consumption of contaminated food, Salmo- nella bacteria enter through the intestinal mucosal epithe- lium by transcytosis. The microbes then replicate in the macrophages of Peyer patches, mesenteric lymph nodes, and the spleen. Bacteremia then occurs with dissemination to lungs, gallbladder, kidneys, or central nervous system. Humans are the only reservoir for S. typhi, so contami- nation of food or water by human feces should be suspected. Clinical Manifestations FIGURE 73–3 Diverticulosis.

Primary and secondary syphilis are treated with a long-acting penicillin, benzathine penicillin G. The drug of choice for chancroid is azithromycin, whereas for lymphogranuloma venereum, it is doxycycline (see Table 74–1). Empiric treatment is often used before diagnostic tests return. As for most sexually transmitted infections, treat- ment that involves one dose and that is observed is pre- ferred if possible. Prevention Consistent use of condoms is an important measure that can prevent genital ulcers. In some cases, primary prevention of HSV infection can be undertaken by treatment of the nega- tive partner in serodiscordant couples with acyclovir or one of its derivatives. Prophylaxis with these drugs can be effec- tive in preventing recurrences of HSV outbreaks in patients who have had frequent occurrences, especially among those who are immunosuppressed.

LUNG ABSCESS Definition Lung abscess is a necrotic process within the lung paren- chyma that frequently results in a cavity with an air-fluid level. Pathophysiology Patients may aspirate oropharyngeal bacteria into the lower airways and alveoli. This usually occurs when the patient is in the recumbent position and cannot clear secretions. For example, aspiration can occur when a person is unconscious from drug overdose, excess alco- hol intake, or the anesthesia that accompanies surgery. Poor oral hygiene is a common predisposing factor. A pneumonitis may first occur, but this can progress to necrosis in a week or so. A lung abscess caused by S. FIGURE 76–2 Lung abscess.

Learning the most likely causative organisms of these classic cases will help you answer the USMLE questions and improve your diagnostic skills. These cases are presented in random order similar to the way they are on the USMLE. The important features of the case are written in boldface. CASE 1 A 22-year-old woman has a severe sore throat. Findings on physical examination include an inflamed throat, swollen cervical lymph nodes, and an enlarged spleen. Her heterophile agglutinin test (Monospot test) is positive. Diagnosis: Infectious mononucleosis caused by Epstein–Barr virus. Other viruses and bacteria, especially Streptococcus pyo- genes, can cause pharyngitis and cervical lymphadenopathy, but an enlarged spleen and a positive Monospot test make infec- tious mononucleosis the most likely diagnosis. See page 296 for additional information. CASE 2 A 5-year-old boy with diabetic ketoacidosis has ptosis of his right eyelid, periorbital swelling, and a black, necrotic skin lesion under his eye. Biopsy of the skin lesion shows nonseptate hyphae with wide-angle branching. Diagnosis: Mucormycosis caused by Mucor or Rhizopus species. Diabetic ketoacidosis and renal acidosis predispose to mucor- mycosis. Fungal spores are inhaled into the sinuses, resulting in lesions on the face. See page 419 for additional information. CASE 3 A 40-year-old man complains of watery, foul-smelling diarrhea and flatulence for the past 2 weeks. He drank untreated water on a camping trip about a month ago. See pear-shaped flagellated trophozoites in stool. Diagnosis: Giardiasis caused by Giardia lamblia. Of the protozoa that are common causes of diarrhea, Giardia and Cryptospo- ridium cause watery diarrhea, whereas Entamoeba causes bloody diarrhea. See page 428 for additional information on Giardia, page 429 for additional information on Cryptosporidium, and page 424 for additional information on Entamoeba. CASE 4 A 35-year-old man who is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody positive has had a persistent headache and a low- grade fever (temperature, 100°F) for the past 2 weeks. See budding yeasts with a wide capsule in India ink preparation of spinal fluid. Diagnosis: Meningitis caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The latex agglutination test, which detects the capsular polysac- charide antigen of Cryptococcus in the spinal fluid, is a more sensitive and specific test than is the test with India ink. See page xx for additional information. If acid-fast rods are seen in spinal fluid, think Mycobacterium tuberculosis. See page 417 for additional information. 691 mebooksfree.com --- Page 703 --- 692 PART XI Clinical Cases CASE 5 A 12-year-old boy has a painful arm that he thought he had injured while pitching in a Little League baseball game. The pain has gotten worse over a 2-week period, and he now has a temperature of 100°F. X-ray of the humerus reveals raised periosteum. Aspirate of lesion reveals gram-positive cocci in clusters. Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus. This organism is the most common cause of osteomyelitis in children. Osteomyelitis in prosthetic joints is often caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. See page 109 for additional informa- tion on staphylococci. CASE 6 A 50-year-old woman receiving chemotherapy via a subclavian catheter for acute leukemia has the sudden onset of blindness in her right eye. Her total white blood cell (WBC) count is 120/μL. Blood cultures grew budding yeasts that formed germ tubes. Diagnosis: Endophthalmitis (infection inside the eye) caused by Candida albicans. A catheter-related infection gave rise to an embolus containing the organism, which traveled through the bloodstream to reach the eye. C. albicans is a member of the normal flora of the skin and enters through a break in the skin at the catheter site. See page 414 for additional information. If the blood culture grew colonies of gram-positive cocci in clusters that were coagulase-negative, think S. epidermidis, another member of the skin flora that is also a common cause of catheter-associated infections. See page 115 for additional information. CASE 7 A 60-year-old man has had a nonproductive cough and fever (temperature, 101°F) for 1 week. He received a kidney transplant 6 weeks ago and has had one episode of rejection that required increased prednisone. There was no response to erythromycin, indicating that Legionella and Mycoplasma are unlikely causes. See owl’s-eye inclusion bodies within the nucleus of infected cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia. These intranuclear inclusions are typical findings in CMV infections. Immu- nosuppression predisposes to disseminated CMV infections. See page 295 for additional information. CASE 8 A 45-year-old woman complains that her right arm has become increasingly weak during the past few days. This morning, she had a generalized seizure. She recently finished a course of cancer chemotherapy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals a lesion resembling an abscess. Brain biopsy shows gram-positive rods in long filaments. Organism is weakly acid-fast. Diagnosis: Brain abscess caused by Nocardia asteroides. Nocardia asteroides initially infects the lung, where it may or may not cause symptoms in immunocompetent people. Dissemination to the brain is common in immunocompromised patients. See page 195 for additional information. CASE 9 A 20-year-old man has a severe headache and vomiting that began yesterday. He is now confused. On examination, his tem- perature is 39°C and his neck is stiff. Spinal fluid reveals no bacteria on Gram stain, 25 lymphs, normal protein, and normal glucose. Culture of the spinal fluid on blood agar shows no bacterial colonies. Diagnosis: Viral meningitis, which is most often caused by Coxsackie virus. Can isolate the virus from spinal fluid. See page 336 for additional information. CASE 10 A 60-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis now has a cough productive of bloody sputum. Chest X-ray reveals a round opaque mass within a cavity in his left upper lobe. Culture of the sputum grew an organism with septate hyphae that had straight, parallel walls. The hyphae exhibited low-angle branching. Diagnosis: “Fungus ball” caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Fungal spores are inhaled into the lung, where they grow within a preexisting cavity caused by infection with meningitis, which is most often caused by Coxsackie virus. Can isolate the virus from spinal fluid. See page 336 for additional information. CASE 10 A 60-year-old man with a history of tuberculosis now has a cough productive of bloody sputum. Chest X-ray reveals a round opaque mass within a cavity in his left upper lobe. Culture of the sputum grew an organism with septate hyphae that had straight, parallel walls. The hyphae exhibited low-angle branching. Diagnosis: “Fungus ball” caused by Aspergillus fumigatus. Fungal spores are inhaled into the lung, where they grow within a preexisting cavity caused by infection with M. tuberculosis. See page 418 for additional information. mebooksfree.com --- Page 704 --- PART XI Clinical Cases 693 CASE 11 A 3-month-old girl has watery, nonbloody diarrhea. Stool culture reveals only normal enteric flora. Diagnosis: Think rotavirus, the most common cause of diarrhea in infants. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test for rotavirus antigen in the stool is positive, which confirms the diagnosis. See page 339 for additional information. CASE 12 A 30-year-old woman has a painless ulcer on her tongue. She is HIV antibody positive and has a CD4 count of 25. Her serum is nonreactive in the VDRL test. Biopsy of the lesion revealed yeasts within macrophages. Diagnosis: Disseminated histoplasmosis caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. Patients with a low CD4 count have severely reduced cell-mediated immunity, which predisposes to disseminated disease caused by this dimorphic fungus. A negative VDRL test indicates the ulcer was not caused by Treponema pallidum. See page 409 for additional information on Histoplasma. CASE 13 A 20-year-old man has a swollen, red, hot, tender ankle, accompanied by a temperature of 100°F for the past 2 days. There is no history of trauma. See gram-negative diplococci in joint fluid aspirate. Organism is oxidase-positive. Diagnosis: Arthritis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the most common cause of infectious arthritis in sexually active adults. Sugar fermentation tests were used to identify the organism as N. gonorrhoeae. See page 132 for additional information. CASE 14 A 40-year-old woman has blurred vision and slurred speech. She is afebrile. She is famous in her neighborhood for her home- canned vegetables and fruits. Diagnosis: Botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin causes a descending paralysis that starts with the cranial nerves, typically appearing initially as diplopia. The toxin is a protease that cleaves the proteins involved in the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Treat with antiserum immediately. Confirm diagnosis with mouse protec- tion test or ELISA test using a sample of food suspected of containing the toxin. See page 139 for additional information. Wound botulism occurs in heroin users (e.g., users of black tar heroin), especially in those who “skin pop.” Bacterial spores in the heroin germinate in the anaerobic conditions in necrotic skin tissue. CASE 15 A neonate was born with a small head (microcephaly), jaundice, and hepatosplenomegaly. Urine contained multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions. Diagnosis: Cytomegalovirus infection acquired in utero. Cytomegalovirus is the leading cause of congenital abnormalities. For fetal infection to occur, the mother must be infected for the first time during pregnancy. She therefore would have no preexisting antibodies to neutralize the virus prior to its infecting the placenta and the fetus. See page 295 for additional information. CASE 16 A 14-year-old girl has a rapidly spreading, painful, erythematous rash on her leg. The rash is warm and tender, and her tem- perature is 38°C. Gram-positive cocci in chains were seen in an aspirate from the lesion. Culture of the aspirate on blood agar grew colonies surrounded by clear (beta) hemolysis. Growth of the organism was inhibited by bacitracin. Diagnosis: Cellulitis caused by S. pyogenes. The rapid spread of cellulitis caused by S. pyogenes is due to hyaluronidase (spread- ing factor) that degrades hyaluronic acid in subcutaneous tissue. Acute glomerulonephritis (AGN) can follow skin infections caused by S. pyogenes. AGN is an immunologic disease caused by antigen–antibody complexes. See page 120 for additional information. mebooksfree.com --- Page 705 --- 694 PART XI Clinical Cases CASE 17 A 4-year-old boy wakes up at night because his anal area is itching. See worm eggs in “Scotch tape” preparation. Diagnosis: Pinworm infection (enterobiasis) caused by Enterobius vermicularis. Pinworm infection is the most common hel- minth disease in the United States. See page 470 for additional information. CASE 18 A 25-year-old woman has a painful, inflamed swollen hand. She was bitten by a cat about 8 hours ago. See small gram-negative rods in the exudate from lesion. Diagnosis: Cellulitis caused by Pasteurella multocida. Organism is normal flora in cat’s mouth. See page 180 for additional information. CASE 19 A 7-year-old girl has bloody diarrhea and fever (temperature, 38°C), but no nausea or vomiting. Only lactose-fermenting colo- nies are seen on EMB agar. Diagnosis: Think either Campylobacter jejuni or enterohemorrhagic strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli O157:H7). If Campylo- bacter is the cause, see colonies on Campylobacter agar containing curved gram-negative rods, and the colonies on EMB agar are likely to be nonpathogenic E. coli. If E. coli O157:H7 is the cause, the organism in the lactose-fermenting colonies on EMB agar is unable to ferment sorbitol. The absence of non–lactose-fermenting colonies indicates that Shigella and Salmonella are not the cause. See page 161 for additional information on Campylobacter and page 154 for additional information on E. coli O157:H7. CASE 20 A 15-year-old girl has had a nonproductive cough and temperature of 100°F for the past 5 days. The symptoms came on gradu- ally. Lung examination shows few scattered rales. Chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrate in left lower lobe but no consolidation. Cold agglutinin test is positive. Diagnosis: Atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This organism is the most common cause of atypical pneumonia in teenagers and young adults. In the cold agglutinin test, antibodies in the patient’s serum agglutinate human red blood cells in the cold (4°C). These antibodies do not react with Mycoplasma. If sputum is available, a PCR test can confirm Mycoplasma infection. See page 197 for additional information. CASE for the past 5 days. The symptoms came on gradu- ally. Lung examination shows few scattered rales. Chest X-ray shows patchy infiltrate in left lower lobe but no consolidation. Cold agglutinin test is positive. Diagnosis: Atypical pneumonia caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. This organism is the most common cause of atypical pneumonia in teenagers and young adults. In the cold agglutinin test, antibodies in the patient’s serum agglutinate human red blood cells in the cold (4°C). These antibodies do not react with Mycoplasma. If sputum is available, a PCR test can confirm Mycoplasma infection. See page 197 for additional information. CASE 21 A 45-year-old man sustained a skull fracture in an automobile accident. The following day, he noted clear fluid dripping from his nose, but he did not notify the hospital personnel. The following day, he spiked a fever to 39°C and complained of a severe headache. Nuchal rigidity was found on physical examination. Spinal fluid analysis revealed a WBC count of 5200/μL, 90% of which were neutrophils. Gram stain showed gram-positive diplococci. Diagnosis: Meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Patients with a fracture of the cribriform plate who leak spinal fluid into the nose are predisposed to meningitis by this organism. Pneumococci can colonize the nasal mucosa and enter the subarachnoid space through the fractured cribriform plate. See page 123 for additional information. CASE 22 A 7-year-old girl was well until about 3 weeks ago, when she began complaining of being “tired all the time.” On examination, her temperature is 38°C and there is tenderness below the right knee. Hemoglobin: 10.2; WBC: 9600 with increased neutro- phils. A sickle cell prep shows a moderate sickling tendency. Gram-negative rods grew in the blood culture. Diagnosis: Osteomyelitis caused by Salmonella species. Sickle cell anemia predisposes to osteomyelitis caused by Salmo- nella species. The abnormally shaped sickle cells are trapped in the small capillaries of the bone and cause microinfarcts. These microinfarcts enhance the likelihood of infection by Salmonella. See page 155 for additional information. CASE 23 A 3-month-old boy has a persistent cough and severe wheezing for the past 2 days. On physical examination, his temperature is 39°C and coarse rhonchi are heard bilaterally. Chest X-ray shows interstitial infiltrates bilaterally. Diagnosis was made by ELISA that detected viral antigen in nasal washings. mebooksfree.com --- Page 706 --- PART XI Clinical Cases 695 Diagnosis: Think pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the most common cause of pneumonia and bron- chiolitis in infants. RSV causes giant cells (syncytia) that can be seen in respiratory secretions and in cell culture. See page 321 for additional information. CASE 24 A 34-year-old man was in his usual state of health until last night, when he felt feverish, had a shaking chill, and became short of breath at rest. Temperature 39°C, blood pressure 110/60, pulse 104, respirations 18. Scattered rales were heard in both bases. A new murmur consistent with tricuspid insufficiency was heard. Needle tracks were seen on both forearms. Gram-positive cocci in clusters grew in blood culture. Diagnosis: Acute endocarditis caused by S. aureus. This organism is the most common cause of acute endocarditis in intrave- nous drug users. The valves on the right side of the heart are often involved. See page 109 for additional information. CASE 25 A 2-week-old infant was well on discharge from the hospital 10 days ago and remained so until last night, when he appeared drowsy and flushed. His skin felt hot to the touch. On physical examination, the infant was very difficult to arouse, but there were no other positive findings. His temperature was 40°C. Blood culture grew gram-positive cocci in chains. A narrow zone of clear (beta) hemolysis was seen around the colonies. Hippurate hydrolysis test was positive. Diagnosis: Neonatal sepsis caused by Streptococcus agalactiae (group B streptococci). Group B streptococci are the most com- mon cause of neonatal sepsis. Think E. coli if gram-negative rods are seen or Listeria monocytogenes if gram-positive rods are seen. See page 121 for additional information on group B streptococci, page 153 for additional information on E. coli, and page 144 for additional information on L. monocytogenes. CASE 26 A 70-year-old woman had a hip replacement because of severe degenerative joint disease. She did well until a year later, when a fall resulted in a fracture of the femur and the prosthesis had to be replaced. Three weeks later, bloody fluid began draining from the wound site. The patient was afebrile, and the physical examination was otherwise unremarkable. Two days later, because of increasing drainage, the wound was debrided and pus was obtained. Gram stain of the pus was negative, but an acid-fast stain revealed red rods. Diagnosis: Prosthetic joint infection caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum-chelonei complex. Think S. epidermidis if gram- positive cocci in clusters are seen. See page 190 for additional information on M. fortuitum-chelonei complex and page 115 for additional information on S. epidermidis. CASE 27 An 80-year-old man complains of a painful rash on his left forehead. The rash is vesicular and only on that side. He is being treated with chemotherapy for leukemia. Smear of material from the base of the vesicle reveals multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions. Diagnosis: Herpes zoster (shingles) caused by varicella-zoster virus. The rash of zoster follows the dermatome of the neuron that was latently infected. Herpes simplex virus type 1 can cause a similar picture. These viruses can be distinguished using fluorescent antibody assay. See page 293 for additional information. CASE 28 A 55-year-old woman has an inflamed ulcer on her right hand and several tender nodules on the inner aspect of her right arm. She is an avid gardener and especially enjoys pruning her roses. Biopsy of the lesion reveals budding yeasts. Diagnosis: Sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii. The organism is a mold in the soil and a yeast in the body (i.e., it is dimorphic). Infection occurs when spores produced by the mold form are introduced into the skin by a penetrating injury. See page 405 for additional information. CASE antibody assay. See page 293 for additional information. CASE 28 A 55-year-old woman has an inflamed ulcer on her right hand and several tender nodules on the inner aspect of her right arm. She is an avid gardener and especially enjoys pruning her roses. Biopsy of the lesion reveals budding yeasts. Diagnosis: Sporotrichosis caused by Sporothrix schenckii. The organism is a mold in the soil and a yeast in the body (i.e., it is dimorphic). Infection occurs when spores produced by the mold form are introduced into the skin by a penetrating injury. See page 405 for additional information. CASE 29 A 15-year-old boy sustained a broken tooth in a fist fight several weeks ago. He now has an inflamed area on the skin over the broken tooth, in the center of which is a draining sinus tract. Gram stain of the drainage fluid reveals filamentous gram- positive rods. mebooksfree.com --- Page 707 --- 696 PART XI Clinical Cases Diagnosis: Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii. See “sulfur granules” in the sinus tract. These granules are particles composed of interwoven filaments of bacteria. See page 194 for additional information. CASE 30 A 24-year-old woman experienced the sudden onset of high fever, myalgias, vomiting, and diarrhea. Her vital signs were as follows: temperature 40°C, blood pressure 70/30, pulse 140, respirations 30. A sunburn-like rash appeared over most of her body. Blood cultures and stool cultures are negative. She is recovering from a surgical procedure on her maxillary sinus, and the bleeding was being staunched with nasal tampons. Gram-positive cocci in clusters were seen in blood adherent to the nasal tampon. Diagnosis: Toxic shock syndrome caused by S. aureus. Toxic shock syndrome toxin is a superantigen that stimulates the release of large amounts of cytokines from many helper T cells. See page 114 for additional information. CASE 31 An 8-year-old girl has a pruritic rash on her chest. Lesions are round or oval with an inflamed border and central clearing. The lesions contain both papules and vesicles. See hyphae in KOH prep of scrapings from the lesion. Diagnosis: Tinea corporis (ringworm) caused by one of the dermatophytes, especially species of Microsporum, Trichophyton, or Epidermophyton. Dermatophytes use keratin as a nutrient source, so lesions are limited to the skin. See page 404 for addi- tional information. CASE 32 A 25-year-old woman has a papular rash on her trunk, arms, and palms. She says the rash does not itch. Vaginal examination reveals two flat, moist, slightly raised lesions on the labia. Material from a labial lesion examined in a dark field microscope revealed spirochetes. Diagnosis: Secondary syphilis caused by T. pallidum. The rash on the palms coupled with the vaginal lesions (condylomata lata) is compatible with secondary syphilis. Serologic tests, such as the nonspecific test (VDRL) and the specific test (FTA- ABS), were positive. See page 201 for additional information. CASE 33 A 5-year-old girl complains of an earache for the past 2 days. On examination, she has a temperature of 39°C, the right external canal contained dried blood, the drum was perforated, and a small amount of purulent fluid was seen. Gram stain of the pus revealed gram-positive diplococci. Colonies formed green (alpha) hemolysis on blood agar. Growth was inhibited by optochin. Diagnosis: Otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae. Think Haemophilus influenzae if small gram-negative rods are seen. These organisms colonize the oropharynx and enter the middle ear via the eustachian tube. See page 123 for additional information on S. pneumoniae and page 171 for additional information on H. influenzae. CASE 34 A 25-year-old woman was well until the sudden onset of high fever (temperature, 40°C) accompanied by several purple skin lesions (ecchymoses, purpura). The lesions are scattered over the body, are irregularly shaped, and are not raised. Her blood pressure is 60/10, and her pulse rate is 140. Blood culture grew gram-negative diplococci. Diagnosis: Meningococcemia caused by Neisseria meningitidis. The endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide, or LPS) of the organism triggers release of interleukin-1, tumor necrosis factor, and nitric oxide from macrophages. These cause the high fever and low blood pressure. The purpuric lesions are a manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Endotoxin acti- vates the coagulation cascade, causing DIC. Lipid A is the toxic part of LPS. See page 130 for additional information. CASE 35 A 40-year-old woman was well until 2 days ago, when she experienced the sudden onset of fever, shaking chills, and profuse sweating. Today, she also complains of headache and abdominal pain but no nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea. She does not have a stiff neck, rash, or altered mental status. Travel history reveals she returned from an extended trip to several countries in central Africa 1 week ago. Blood smear reveals ring-shaped trophozoites within red blood cells. mebooksfree.com --- Page 708 --- PART XI Clinical Cases 697 Diagnosis: Malaria caused by Plasmodium species. If banana-shaped gametocytes seen in the blood smear, think Plasmodium falciparum. Plasmodium falciparum is the species that causes the life-threatening complications of malaria, such as cerebral malaria. The fever and chills experienced by the patient coincide with the release of merozoites from infected red blood cells and occur in either a tertian or quartan pattern. See page 433 for additional information. CASE 36 A 35-year-old man is seen in the emergency room (ER) complaining of severe headache and vomiting that began last night. His temperature is 40°C. While in the ER, he is increasingly combative and has a grand mal seizure. He is “foaming at the mouth” and cannot drink any liquids. Analysis of his spinal fluid reveals no abnormality, and no organisms are seen in the Gram stain. Two days later, despite supportive measures, he dies. Pathologic examination of the brain reveals eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of neurons. Diagnosis: Rabies (an encephalitis) caused by rabies virus. The inclusions are Negri bodies. Diagnosis can be confirmed by using fluorescent antibody assays. The patient was a farm worker who was bitten by a bat about a month prior to the onset of symptoms. Note the long incubation grand mal seizure. He is “foaming at the mouth” and cannot drink any liquids. Analysis of his spinal fluid reveals no abnormality, and no organisms are seen in the Gram stain. Two days later, despite supportive measures, he dies. Pathologic examination of the brain reveals eosinophilic inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of neurons. Diagnosis: Rabies (an encephalitis) caused by rabies virus. The inclusions are Negri bodies. Diagnosis can be confirmed by using fluorescent antibody assays. The patient was a farm worker who was bitten by a bat about a month prior to the onset of symptoms. Note the long incubation period, which can be as long as 6 months. People bitten by a bat (or any wild animal) should receive rabies immunization consisting of the inactivated vaccine plus rabies immune globulins (passive–active immu- nization). See page 326 for additional information. CASE 37 A 70-year-old man was admitted to the hospital after suffering extensive third-degree burns. Three days later, he spiked a fever, and there was pus on the dressing that had a blue–green color. Gram stain of the pus revealed gram-negative rods. Diagnosis: Wound (burn) infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The blue-green color is caused by pyocyanin, a pig- ment produced by the organism. See page 165 for additional information. CASE 38 A 65-year-old woman reports that she has had several episodes of confusion and memory loss during the past few weeks. On examination, she is afebrile but has a staggering gait and myoclonus can be elicited. Over the next several months, her condition deteriorates and death ensues. On autopsy, microscopic examination of the brain reveals many vacuoles but no viral inclusion bodies. Diagnosis: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) caused by prions. CJD is a spongiform encephalopathy. The vacuoles give the brain a sponge-like appearance. See page 374 for additional information. CASE 39 A 20-year-old man complains of several episodes of blood in his urine. He has no dysuria or urethral discharge. He is not sexu- ally active. He is a college student but was born and raised in Egypt. Physical examination reveals no penile lesions. Urinalysis shows many red cells, no white cells, and several large eggs with terminal spines. Diagnosis: Schistosomiasis caused by Schistosoma haematobium. Schistosome eggs in venules of the bladder damage the blad- der epithelium and cause bleeding. The eggs are excreted in the urine. See page 462 for additional information. CASE 40 A 35-year-old man complains of night sweats, chills, and fatigue at varying intervals during the past 2 months. These episodes began while he was traveling in Latin America. When questioned, he says that cheeses, especially the unpasteurized varieties, are some of his favorite foods. On examination, his temperature is 39°C, and his liver and spleen are palpable. His hematocrit is 30%, and his WBC count is 5000. Blood culture grew small gram-negative rods. Diagnosis: Brucellosis caused by Brucella species. Domestic animals such as cows and goats are the main reservoir for Brucella, and it is often transmitted in unpasteurized dairy products. This patient could also have typhoid fever caused by Salmonella typhi, but S. typhi is only a human pathogen (i.e., there is no animal reservoir). See page 177 for additional infor- mation on Brucella species and page 155 for additional information on S. typhi. CASE 41 A 6-year-old girl has a rash on her face that appeared yesterday. The rash is erythematous and located over the malar emi- nences bilaterally. The rash is macular; there are no papules, vesicles, or pustules. A few days prior to the appearance of the rash, she had a runny nose and anorexia. mebooksfree.com --- Page 709 --- 698 PART XI Clinical Cases Diagnosis: Slapped cheek syndrome caused by parvovirus B19. This virus also causes aplastic anemia because it prefer- entially infects and kills erythroblasts. It also infects the fetus, causing hydrops fetalis, and causes an immune complex– mediated arthritis, especially in adult women. See page 308 for additional information. CASE 42 A 20-year-old man fell off his motorcycle and suffered a compound fracture of the femur. The fracture was surgically reduced and the wound debrided. Forty-eight hours later, he spiked a fever (temperature, 40°C), and the wound area became necrotic. Crepitus was felt, and a foul-smelling odor was perceived originating from the wound. Marked anemia and a WBC count of 22,800 were found. Gram stain of the exudate showed large gram-positive rods. Colonies grew on blood agar incubated anaerobically but not aerobically. Diagnosis: Gas gangrene (myonecrosis) caused by Clostridium perfringens. The main virulence factor produced by this organ- ism is an exotoxin that is a lecithinase. It causes necrosis of tissue and lysis of red blood cells (causing hemolytic anemia). The spores of the organism are in the soil and enter at the wound site. A foul-smelling exudate is characteristic of infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. See page 140 for additional information. CASE 43 A 30-year-old woman complains of a burning feeling in her mouth and pain on swallowing. Sexual history reveals she is a commercial sex worker and has had unprotected vaginal, oral, and anal intercourse with multiple partners. On examination, whitish lesions are seen on the tongue, palate, and pharynx. No vesicles are seen. The test for HIV antibody is positive, and her CD4 count is 65. Gram stain of material from the lesions reveals budding yeasts and pseudohyphae. Diagnosis: Thrush caused by C. albicans. This organism forms pseudohyphae when it invades tissue. The absence of vesicles indicates that her symptoms are not caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. See page 414 for additional information. CASE 44 You’re a physician at a refugee camp in sub-Saharan Africa, when an outbreak of diarrhea occurs. Massive amounts of watery stool, without blood, are produced by the patients. Curved gram-negative rods are seen in a Gram stain of the stool. Diagnosis: Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. There are three genera of curved gram-negative rods: Vibrio, Campylobacter, and Helicobacter. V. cholerae causes watery, nonbloody diarrhea, whereas C. jejuni typically causes bloody diarrhea. Helicobacter pylori causes gastritis and peptic ulcer, vesicles indicates that her symptoms are not caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. See page 414 for additional information. CASE 44 You’re a physician at a refugee camp in sub-Saharan Africa, when an outbreak of diarrhea occurs. Massive amounts of watery stool, without blood, are produced by the patients. Curved gram-negative rods are seen in a Gram stain of the stool. Diagnosis: Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae. There are three genera of curved gram-negative rods: Vibrio, Campylobacter, and Helicobacter. V. cholerae causes watery, nonbloody diarrhea, whereas C. jejuni typically causes bloody diarrhea. Helicobacter pylori causes gastritis and peptic ulcer, not diarrhea. Enterotoxigenic E. coli causes watery diarrhea by producing an exotoxin that has the same mode of action as does the exotoxin produced by V. cholerae. However, E. coli is a straight gram- negative rod, not a curved one. If an outbreak of bloody diarrhea had occurred in the refugee camp, then Shigella dysenteriae would be the most likely cause. See the following pages for additional information: Vibrio, page 159; Campylobacter, page 161; Helicobacter, page 162; Escherichia, page 153; and Shigella, page 158. CASE 45 A 40-year-old man with low-grade fever and night sweats for the past 4 weeks now has increasing fatigue and shortness of breath. He says he has difficulty climbing the one flight of stairs to his apartment. Pertinent past history includes rheumatic fever when he was 15 years old and the extraction of two wisdom teeth about 3 weeks before his symptoms began. No che- moprophylaxis was given at the time of the extractions. There is no history of intravenous drug use. His temperature is 38.5°C, and a loud holosystolic murmur can be heard over the precordium. His spleen is palpable. He is anemic, and his WBC count is 13,500. Blood cultures grow gram-positive cocci in chains that produce green (alpha) hemolysis on blood agar. Growth is not inhibited by optochin. Diagnosis: Subacute bacterial endocarditis caused by one of the viridans group streptococci, such as Streptococcus sanguinis. The laboratory findings are also compatible with Enterococcus faecalis, but the history of dental surgery makes the viridans group streptococci more likely to be the cause. Endocarditis caused by E. faecalis is associated with gastrointestinal or genito- urinary tract surgery. See page 121 for additional information on both viridans group streptococci and E. faecalis. CASE 46 A 60-year-old woman is asymptomatic but has a lung nodule seen on chest X-ray. Pertinent past history includes her cigarette smoking (2 packs per day for 40 years) and her occupation as an archaeologist, digging primarily in Arizona and New Mexico. Because of concern that the nodule may be malignant, it was surgically removed. Pathologic examination revealed large (25 μm) round structures with thick walls and many round spores inside. No malignant cells were seen. mebooksfree.com --- Page 710 --- PART XI Clinical Cases 699 Diagnosis: Coccidioidomycosis caused by Coccidioides immitis. These structures are spherules, which are pathognomonic for this disease. The mold form of the organism is found in the soil of the southwestern United States, and the organism is acquired by inhalation of arthrospores produced by the mold. The inhaled arthrospores form spherules in the lung. Coccidioides immitis is dimorphic and forms spherules at 37°C. See page 407 for additional information. CASE 47 A 20-year-old woman in her 30th week of pregnancy had an ultrasound examination that revealed a growth-retarded fetus with a large head (indicating hydrocephalus) and calcifications within the brain. Umbilical blood was cultured, and crescent- shaped trophozoites were grown. Diagnosis: Toxoplasmosis caused by Toxoplasma gondii. Detection of IgM antibody in the Sabin-Feldman dye test can also be used to make a diagnosis. The main reservoir is domestic cats. Domestic farm animals, such as cattle, acquire the organism by accidentally eating cat feces. Pregnant women should not be exposed to cat litter or eat undercooked meat. See page 438 for additional information. CASE 48 A 10-day-old neonate has several vesicles on the scalp and around the eyes. The child is otherwise well, afebrile, and feeding normally. A Giemsa-stained smear of material from the base of a vesicle revealed multinucleated giant cells with intranuclear inclusions. Diagnosis: Neonatal infection caused by herpes simplex virus type 2. Infection is acquired during passage through the birth canal. Life-threatening encephalitis and disseminated infection of the neonate also occur. See page 292 for additional information. CASE 49 A 40-year-old woman has just had a grand mal seizure. There is a history of headaches for the past week and one episode of vertigo but no previous seizures. She is afebrile. She is a native of Honduras but has lived in the United States for the past 5 years. MRI reveals a mass in the parietal lobe. Surgical removal of the mass reveals a larva within a cystlike sac. Diagnosis: Cysticercosis caused by the larva of Taenia solium. Infection is acquired by ingesting the tapeworm eggs, not by ingesting undercooked pork. This clinical picture can also be caused by a brain abscess, a granuloma such as a tuberculoma, or a brain tumor. See page 454 for additional information. CASE 50 A 1-week-old neonate has a yellowish exudate in the corners of both eyes. The child is otherwise well, afebrile, and feeding normally. Gram stain of the exudate reveals no gram-negative diplococci. A Giemsa-stained smear of the exudate reveals a large cytoplasmic inclusion. Diagnosis: Conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Confirm the diagnosis with direct fluorescent antibody test. Infection is acquired during passage through the birth canal. The inclusion contains large numbers of the intracellular repli- cating forms called reticulate bodies.
